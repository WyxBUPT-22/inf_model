It refers to a collection of sequences in a random process that are most likely to occur, as they contain the majority of the probability mass. These sequences satisfy specific probability bounds, making them representative of the typical behavior of the random process. The typical set plays a crucial role in the proof of the Joint Source-Channel Coding Theorem, where it is used to characterize the sequences that dominate the probabilistic outcomes of the process. In essence, the typical set encapsulates the sequences that are statistically significant and expected in the long run, providing a foundation for understanding the behavior of random processes in information theory.\",3\r\n374,JOINT SOURCE-CHANNEL CODING THEOREM,\"The theorem states that for a random process with entropy less than the channel capacity, there exists a source-channel coding that allows the error probability to approach zero.
