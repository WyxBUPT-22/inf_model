Its movement is constrained by its position: it has 8 possible moves when located in the interior of the board, 5 possible moves when positioned on the edges, and only 3 possible moves when situated in the corners. This description highlights the KING's role and movement mechanics within the game of chess.\n\nSecond, KING is also identified as a researcher who collaborated with Cover on the estimation of English entropy. This suggests that KING has contributed to the field of information theory or linguistics, specifically in analyzing and quantifying the entropy of the English language. This collaboration underscores KING's involvement in academic research and their work in a specialized area of study.\n\nIn summary, the term \"\"KING\"\" encompasses both a chess piece with specific movement rules and a researcher known for their collaboration on the estimation of English entropy.
