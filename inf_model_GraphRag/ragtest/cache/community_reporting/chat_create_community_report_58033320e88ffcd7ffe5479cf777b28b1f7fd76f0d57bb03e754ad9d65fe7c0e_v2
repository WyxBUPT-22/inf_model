This property, known as the Markov property, defines a Markov chain as a type of Markov process. It is often described as a stochastic process that undergoes transitions from one state to another according to specific probabilistic rules, typically represented by a transition probability matrix. \n\nMarkov chains are widely used in various applications, including maximum entropy calculations and illustrating theoretical concepts in probability. They are referenced extensively in academic texts, with mentions across numerous pages (e.g., 35, 36, 39, 40, 47, 52, 71-100, 144, 206, 258, 294, 295, 423, 458, 470, 497, 499, 578-580, and 584). A first-order binary Markov chain is a specific example used to simplify and demonstrate the principles of Markov processes. \n\nIn summary, a Markov chain is a stochastic process defined by its dependence on the current state rather than its history, making it a powerful tool for modeling systems with probabilistic transitions.\",10\r\n174,MARKOV PROCESS,,2\r\n199,STATIONARY PROCESS,A stationary process is discussed in the context of entropy rates and comparisons between different processes.,2\r\n200,EDGE PROCESS,\"The **EDGE PROCESS** is a concept derived from a Markov chain, designed to track and capture the transitions between states within the state space. By monitoring these transitions, the edge process forms a new process that is intrinsically associated with the original Markov chain. This process emphasizes the sequence of edges, or transitions, rather than the states themselves, providing a detailed representation of the dynamics and pathways within the Markov chain. In essence, the edge process serves as a complementary framework to analyze and understand the behavior of the underlying Markovian system.\",1\r\n205,TRANSITION PROBABILITY MATRIX,,1\r\n173,STATIONARY DISTRIBUTION,\"The **Stationary Distribution** is a fundamental concept in the study of Markov chains, representing a probability distribution that remains unchanged as time progresses. It characterizes the long-term behavior of the process, ensuring that the system's state probabilities do not vary over time once the stationary distribution is reached. This distribution is crucial for understanding the equilibrium or steady-state behavior of Markov processes, as it provides insights into the system's stability and predictability over extended periods. Both descriptions emphasize the invariance of the stationary distribution as the system evolves, highlighting its significance in analyzing the dynamics of Markov chains.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n173,MARKOV CHAIN,MARKOV PROCESS,A Markov chain is a specific type of Markov process,12\r\n203,STATIONARY PROCESS,MARKOV CHAIN,The Markov chain is described as a stationary process with a transition probability matrix and stationary distribution,12\r\n204,EDGE PROCESS,MARKOV CHAIN,\"The edge process is directly associated with the transitions of the Markov chain\nThe edge process is derived from the transitions of the Markov chain\",11\r\n210,MARKOV CHAIN,TRANSITION PROBABILITY MATRIX,The transition probability matrix defines the behavior of a Markov chain by specifying the probabilities of moving between states,11\r\n175,STATIONARY DISTRIBUTION,MARKOV PROCESS,A stationary distribution can be associated with a Markov process if it is a Markov chain,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
