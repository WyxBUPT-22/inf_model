It is characterized by its transition matrix, which exhibits symmetry in its structure. In a symmetric channel, the rows and columns of the transition matrix are permutations of each other, ensuring a balanced and uniform relationship between input and output probabilities. This symmetry allows for the calculation of the channel's capacity using the formula \\( C = \\log|I| - H(\\text{transition matrix rows}) \\), where \\( H \\) represents the entropy of the transition matrix rows.
