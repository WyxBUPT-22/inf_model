The theorem states that a source can be transmitted over a noiseless channel if and only if the entropy rate of the source is less than the channel's capacity. This principle has been extended to multi-user scenarios, broadening its applicability in complex communication systems. Additionally, the theorem asserts that source codes and channel codes can be designed independently and then combined to achieve optimal performance. This separation simplifies the design process by allowing the development of efficient source compression and error-correcting channel codes without requiring joint optimization.
