It serves as an example of data compression, where frequently occurring characters are assigned shorter descriptions to optimize efficiency in communication. Historically, Morse code has been a significant communication method, particularly in telegraphy, and is often referenced in discussions of early technological advancements in data transmission. Its development and use mark an important milestone in the evolution of communication systems.\",3\r\n228,SHANNON CODE,\"The Shannon Code is a method of encoding information rooted in information theory, designed to efficiently compress data based on the probability distribution of the source. It constructs prefix codes by assigning codewords to the values of a random variable X, where the length of each codeword is determined by the probability of the corresponding value. This approach ensures that more probable values are represented by shorter codewords, aligning with the principles of entropy bounds in binary distributions. While the Shannon Code is effective in achieving data compression, it is often considered less efficient compared to the Huffman code, which optimizes codeword lengths more precisely.
