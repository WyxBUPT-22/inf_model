It is characterized by the presence of additive Gaussian noise, which follows a normal distribution, often attributed to the central limit theorem. This model is particularly significant in network information theory due to its strong physical background and the ability to provide specific, easily interpretable results. \n\nThe Gaussian Channel is defined as a time-discrete channel where the output signal is the sum of the input signal and Gaussian noise. It is employed to study key aspects of communication systems, including information transmission capacity, error probabilities, and the impact of noise on signal integrity. The channel is also subject to power constraints and noise variance, which are critical parameters in calculating channel capacity and error probability.\n\nIn practical applications, the Gaussian Channel simulates various real-world communication systems, such as radio and satellite communications, where noise is a significant factor. Additionally, the model is discussed in the context of feedback, exploring how feedback mechanisms influence the channel's performance and capacity. Overall, the Gaussian Channel serves as a classic and versatile tool in information theory, providing insights into the behavior of communication systems under noisy conditions.\",35\r\n421,POWER CONSTRAINT,\"The **Power Constraint** refers to a limitation imposed on the average power of the input signal in a Gaussian channel. This constraint is denoted by the symbol **P** and serves to restrict the maximum allowable power of the transmitted signal. By defining this boundary, the power constraint ensures that the signal remains within specified operational limits, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of communication systems in Gaussian channels.\",3\r\n422,NOISE VARIANCE,\"The **NOISE VARIANCE**, denoted by \\( N \\), is a fundamental measure in the context of a Gaussian channel. It quantifies the variance of the noise present in the channel, which is essential for calculating the channel capacity. This metric plays a critical role in understanding and analyzing the performance and limitations of communication systems operating under noisy conditions.\",3\r\n19,GAUSSIAN COLORED NOISE CHANNEL,\"The **Gaussian Colored Noise Channel** is a specialized type of Gaussian channel characterized by non-white noise, as discussed in Chapter 9. This channel represents a scenario involving parallel channels with correlated Gaussian noise, which can model both parallel and memory-based Gaussian noise channels. Unlike white noise, where the noise components are uncorrelated, the noise in a Gaussian Colored Noise Channel exhibits correlation, making it a more complex and realistic model for certain communication systems. This channel is particularly useful in scenarios where noise correlation plays a significant role, such as in multi-channel or time-dependent communication environments.\",2\r\n428,GAUSSIAN CHANNEL CODING THEOREM,\"The Gaussian channel coding theorem establishes the capacity of a Gaussian channel under a power constraint\"\"\",2\r\n18,PARALLEL GAUSSIAN CHANNELS,\"Parallel Gaussian Channels are a set of independent Gaussian channels operating simultaneously, covered in Chapter 9>\",1\r\n20,FEEDBACK GAUSSIAN CHANNEL,\"Feedback Gaussian Channel is a Gaussian channel where feedback is used to improve communication, covered in Chapter 9>\",1\r\n418,CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM,\"The **Central Limit Theorem** is a fundamental theorem in probability theory that describes the behavior of the sum or average of a large number of independent random variables. It states that, under certain conditions, the cumulative effect of these variables will asymptotically follow a normal distribution, regardless of the underlying distribution of the individual variables. This theorem is widely applicable in various fields, including statistics, communication channels, and other scenarios where the aggregation of numerous small random events is analyzed.
