It is characterized by binary inputs and ternary outputs, where each transmitted bit is either received correctly or erased. The channel's capacity, which represents the maximum rate of reliable communication, is given by \\( C = 1 - \\alpha \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) denotes the probability of erasure. This model is particularly useful for analyzing the capacity region in multiple access communication systems, where multiple users share the same communication channel.

This symmetry allows for the calculation of the channel's capacity using the formula \\( C = \\log|I| - H(\\text{transition matrix rows}) \\), where \\( H \\) represents the entropy of the transition matrix rows.
