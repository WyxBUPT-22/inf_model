It asserts that reliable transmission is achievable provided the code rate does not exceed the channel's capacity. This theorem was rigorously proven by **Wolfowitz**, who utilized concepts from the method of types to establish its validity. The theorem serves as a cornerstone in understanding the limits and capabilities of communication systems, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing data transmission.\",3\r\n333,RANDOM CODE SELECTION,\"Random code selection is a method used in the proof of the channel capacity theorem, where the average error probability is calculated over randomly chosen codebooks\",2\r\n394,WOLFOWITZ,\"Wolfowitz is a notable figure in the field of information theory, recognized for his significant contributions to the understanding of channel capacity and related theorems. He provided the first proof of the strong converse theorem, employing techniques akin to those used in typical sequences. Additionally, Wolfowitz utilized innovative ideas to prove the channel capacity theorem, further solidifying his impact on the field. His work has been instrumental in advancing the theoretical foundations of information theory, demonstrating his expertise and pioneering approach to complex problems.\",3\r\n332,CHANNEL CODING THEOREM,\"The Channel Coding Theorem is a fundamental and key result in information theory that establishes the conditions for reliable communication over noisy channels. It defines the maximum rate, known as the channel capacity, at which information can be transmitted through a noisy channel with arbitrarily low error probability. The theorem states that all transmission rates below this channel capacity are achievable with negligible error probability, while rates above the capacity are not. This principle underscores the possibility of reliable communication even in the presence of noise, provided the code rate remains within the channel's capacity. The Channel Coding Theorem is a cornerstone of information theory, providing a theoretical foundation for the design and analysis of communication systems.\",9\r\n336,JOINTLY TYPICAL DECODING,\"Jointly Typical Decoding is a method used in information theory to decode messages by checking if the received sequence and the transmitted codeword are jointly typical, ensuring low error probability.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n351,SHANNON,CHANNEL CAPACITY THEOREM,\"SHANNON introduced the concept of the CHANNEL CAPACITY THEOREM in his seminal paper published in 1948.
