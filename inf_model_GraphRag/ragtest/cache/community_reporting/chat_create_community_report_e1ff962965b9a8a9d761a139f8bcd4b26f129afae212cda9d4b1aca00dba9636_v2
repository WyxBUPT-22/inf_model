Specifically, it applies to unbiased estimators, ensuring that their variance cannot be smaller than a certain threshold defined by the inequality. This principle is widely discussed in statistical literature, including in Chapter 11 of relevant texts, and serves as a critical tool for evaluating the efficiency of estimators in statistical analysis. The inequality underscores the inherent limitations in the precision of parameter estimation, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding the performance of estimators in practice.\",5\r\n24,FISHER INFORMATION,\"The **Fisher Information** is a fundamental concept in mathematical statistics that quantifies the amount of information that an observable random variable carries about an unknown parameter of a distribution. It plays a crucial role in parameter estimation, providing a measure of how well the parameter can be estimated from the observed data. Specifically, Fisher Information evaluates the sensitivity of the likelihood function to changes in the parameter, thereby indicating the precision with which the parameter can be inferred. This concept is extensively covered in statistical literature, including Chapter 11 of the referenced text, and is widely used in various applications of statistical modeling and inference.\",7\r\n548,UNBIASED ESTIMATOR,\"An unbiased estimator is a statistical estimator whose expected value equals the true value of the parameter being estimated. This means that, on average, the estimator provides an accurate and unbiased representation of the parameter it is designed to estimate. The concept of an unbiased estimator is fundamental in statistics, as it ensures that the estimation process does not systematically overestimate or underestimate the true parameter value.
