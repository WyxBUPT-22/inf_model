It is analogous to the law of large numbers and states that, as the length of a sequence of random variables increases, the log-likelihood of the sequence approaches the entropy of the source. This property highlights the existence of \"\"typical sequences,\"\" which are sequences whose probability is close to \\(2^{-nH}\\), where \\(H\\) is the entropy of the source and \\(n\\) is the sequence length. The AEP is primarily used in information theory to analyze data compression, coding, and the efficiency of communication systems.

In this context, the Venn Diagram consists of three circles that intersect to create four distinct regions. These regions are used to place information bits and parity bits, ensuring even parity within each circle.

This strategy, which optimizes bet sizing to maximize long-term growth, draws parallels to the decision-making process in horse racing, where bettors must assess probabilities and potential payouts to make informed wagers.
