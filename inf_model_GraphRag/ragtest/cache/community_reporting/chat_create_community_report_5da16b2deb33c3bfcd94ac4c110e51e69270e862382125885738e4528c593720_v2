It serves as a foundational example of error correction techniques, illustrating basic principles common to most codes. The primary purpose of the Hamming Code is to recover original messages despite information loss or corruption during transmission. Specifically, it is designed to correct up to one error in a 7-bit code word. The code is characterized by its parameters (7,4,3), where 7 represents the block length, 4 denotes the number of information bits, and 3 signifies the minimum distance between code words. This combination of simplicity and efficiency makes the Hamming Code a widely studied and applied method in the field of error detection and correction.\",6\r\n352,ERROR-CORRECTING CODE,An error-correcting code is a method of encoding data to detect and correct errors that occur during transmission or storage. The Hamming code is an example of an error-correcting code,2\r\n134,VENN DIAGRAM,\"A Venn Diagram is a graphical representation used to illustrate relationships between sets, including mutual information in probability theory. It is particularly useful in visualizing the interactions and overlaps between different groups or categories. One practical application of a Venn Diagram is in explaining the working principle of the Hamming code, a method for error detection and correction in data transmission. In this context, the Venn Diagram consists of three circles that intersect to create four distinct regions. These regions are used to place information bits and parity bits, ensuring even parity within each circle. This approach helps in identifying and correcting errors by analyzing the overlapping areas of the diagram. Thus, the Venn Diagram serves as both a theoretical tool for understanding set relationships and a practical tool for implementing error-correcting codes like the Hamming code.\",2\r\n349,PARITY CHECK MATRIX,\"The parity check matrix is a matrix used in the Hamming code to detect and correct errors in the received code word. It has the property that for any code word c, Hc=0\",1\r\n350,SYSTEMATIC CODE,\"A systematic code is a type of linear code where the first k bits of the code word represent the message, and the remaining n-k bits are parity check bits.

It refers to the smallest number of positions in which any two code words differ. This parameter is crucial as it directly influences the error-detecting and error-correcting capabilities of a code. A larger minimum distance generally indicates a stronger ability to correct errors, making it a key metric in the design and analysis of coding systems.
