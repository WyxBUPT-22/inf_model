It measures the difference between two probability distributions, quantifying the distance between them and their respective information content. Introduced in Chapter 8 of the text, relative entropy is a broader measure that encompasses various applications, including mutual information, which is considered a special case of it. The concept has significant contributions from notable figures such as Csiszár, Kullback, and Kemperman. Relative entropy is utilized in diverse contexts, including the Chernoff-Stein lemma and channel capacity calculations, highlighting its importance in both theoretical and applied domains. Overall, relative entropy serves as a key tool for analyzing and comparing probability distributions in information theory and related fields.\",14\r\n69,CHANNEL CAPACITY,\"**CHANNEL CAPACITY** is a fundamental concept in information theory, representing the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communication channel with negligible or arbitrarily low error probability. This concept is central to understanding the limits of data transmission and is closely associated with Shannon's theorem, which defines the theoretical upper bound for reliable communication. The channel capacity is mathematically expressed through formulas such as \\( C = W \\log(1 + P/N_0W) \\) for general communication channels and \\( C = (1/2) \\log(1 + P/N) \\) for Gaussian channels, where \\( W \\) represents bandwidth, \\( P \\) is the signal power, and \\( N \\) or \\( N_0 \\) denotes noise power. These formulas highlight the relationship between bandwidth, signal strength, and noise in determining the maximum achievable transmission rate. While some descriptions emphasize the absence of error and others focus on low error probability, the overarching principle remains consistent: channel capacity quantifies the optimal performance of a communication system under given constraints. Additionally, the concept is relevant in broader contexts, such as its application in source coding and game theory, further underscoring its significance in both theoretical and practical domains of information science.\",18\r\n574,MINIMAX THEOREM,\"The minimax theorem is a fundamental result in game theory that establishes conditions under which the minimum of a maximum equals the maximum of a minimum for certain functions\"\"\",2\r\n380,SOURCE-CHANNEL THEOREM,\"The Source-Channel Theorem states that a random process with entropy rate H can be reliably transmitted over a discrete memoryless channel if H is less than the channel capacity C.\"\"\",1\r\n425,POWER LIMIT,,1\r\n1708,SELF-INFORMATION,Self-information is a concept in information theory mentioned in the text,1\r\n1924,RAYLEIGH DISTRIBUTION,,1\r\n1922,REVERSE WATER-FILLING,Reverse water-filling is a technique used in information theory to allocate resources optimally in certain communication scenarios,2\r\n1923,RIEMANN INTEGRABILITY,Riemann integrability is a mathematical concept related to the integration of functions,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n17,RELATIVE ENTROPY,MUTUAL INFORMATION,\"RELATIVE ENTROPY and MUTUAL INFORMATION are closely related concepts in information theory.
