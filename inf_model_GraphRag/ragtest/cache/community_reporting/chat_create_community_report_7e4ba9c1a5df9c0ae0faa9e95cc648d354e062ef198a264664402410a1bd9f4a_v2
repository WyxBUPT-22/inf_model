It is characterized by the presence of additive Gaussian noise, which follows a normal distribution, often attributed to the central limit theorem. This model is particularly significant in network information theory due to its strong physical background and the ability to provide specific, easily interpretable results. \n\nThe Gaussian Channel is defined as a time-discrete channel where the output signal is the sum of the input signal and Gaussian noise. It is employed to study key aspects of communication systems, including information transmission capacity, error probabilities, and the impact of noise on signal integrity. The channel is also subject to power constraints and noise variance, which are critical parameters in calculating channel capacity and error probability.\n\nIn practical applications, the Gaussian Channel simulates various real-world communication systems, such as radio and satellite communications, where noise is a significant factor. Additionally, the model is discussed in the context of feedback, exploring how feedback mechanisms influence the channel's performance and capacity. Overall, the Gaussian Channel serves as a classic and versatile tool in information theory, providing insights into the behavior of communication systems under noisy conditions.\",35\r\n18,PARALLEL GAUSSIAN CHANNELS,\"Parallel Gaussian Channels are a set of independent Gaussian channels operating simultaneously, covered in Chapter 9>\",1\r\n20,FEEDBACK GAUSSIAN CHANNEL,\"Feedback Gaussian Channel is a Gaussian channel where feedback is used to improve communication, covered in Chapter 9>\",1\r\n418,CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM,\"The **Central Limit Theorem** is a fundamental theorem in probability theory that describes the behavior of the sum or average of a large number of independent random variables.

This theorem is widely applicable in various fields, including statistics, communication channels, and other scenarios where the aggregation of numerous small random events is analyzed.
