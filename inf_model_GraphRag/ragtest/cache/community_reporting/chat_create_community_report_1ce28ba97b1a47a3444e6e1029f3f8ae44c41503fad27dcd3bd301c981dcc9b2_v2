This property, known as the Markov property, defines a Markov chain as a type of Markov process. It is often described as a stochastic process that undergoes transitions from one state to another according to specific probabilistic rules, typically represented by a transition probability matrix. \n\nMarkov chains are widely used in various applications, including maximum entropy calculations and illustrating theoretical concepts in probability. They are referenced extensively in academic texts, with mentions across numerous pages (e.g., 35, 36, 39, 40, 47, 52, 71-100, 144, 206, 258, 294, 295, 423, 458, 470, 497, 499, 578-580, and 584). A first-order binary Markov chain is a specific example used to simplify and demonstrate the principles of Markov processes. \n\nIn summary, a Markov chain is a stochastic process defined by its dependence on the current state rather than its history, making it a powerful tool for modeling systems with probabilistic transitions.\",10\r\n568,MAXIMUM ENTROPY PROCESS,,3\r\n174,MARKOV PROCESS,,2\r\n199,STATIONARY PROCESS,A stationary process is discussed in the context of entropy rates and comparisons between different processes.,2\r\n194,RANDOM WALK ON A 3X3 CHESSBOARD,\"A random walk of a king on a 3x3 chessboard is described as a Markov chain, with questions about its entropy rate and comparisons to other chess pieces like rooks, bishops, and queens. Bishops are noted to have two types.\",1\r\n197,ENTROPY RATE,\"The **Entropy Rate** is a fundamental concept in information theory, representing the average entropy per symbol in a stochastic process as the sequence length approaches infinity. It serves as a measure of the uncertainty or randomness inherent in the process. The entropy rate is particularly relevant in the context of **Slepian-Wolf encoding**, where it is utilized for joint source coding, enabling efficient compression of correlated sources. Additionally, it is discussed in the broader framework of **language models**, where it helps quantify the predictability and complexity of sequences. The concept is also applied to **stationary processes**, with comparisons made between different processes to analyze and contrast their respective entropy rates. Overall, the entropy rate provides a critical metric for understanding the information content and randomness in various stochastic systems.\",10\r\n195,3D MAZE,\"A bird is lost in a 3x3x3 cubic maze, with questions about the stationary distribution and entropy rate of its random walk between adjacent rooms.\",1\r\n196,MAXIMUM ENTROPY GRAPH,A random walk on a connected graph with 4 edges is analyzed to determine which graph has the highest and lowest entropy rates.,1\r\n198,MARKOV CHAIN TRANSITIONS,\"An irreducible Markov chain with a transition probability matrix and stationary distribution is described, along with an associated edge process.\",1\r\n200,EDGE PROCESS,\"The **EDGE PROCESS** is a concept derived from a Markov chain, designed to track and capture the transitions between states within the state space. By monitoring these transitions, the edge process forms a new process that is intrinsically associated with the original Markov chain. This process emphasizes the sequence of edges, or transitions, rather than the states themselves, providing a detailed representation of the dynamics and pathways within the Markov chain. In essence, the edge process serves as a complementary framework to analyze and understand the behavior of the underlying Markovian system.\",1\r\n205,TRANSITION PROBABILITY MATRIX,,1\r\n173,STATIONARY DISTRIBUTION,\"The **Stationary Distribution** is a fundamental concept in the study of Markov chains, representing a probability distribution that remains unchanged as time progresses. It characterizes the long-term behavior of the process, ensuring that the system's state probabilities do not vary over time once the stationary distribution is reached. This distribution is crucial for understanding the equilibrium or steady-state behavior of Markov processes, as it provides insights into the system's stability and predictability over extended periods.
