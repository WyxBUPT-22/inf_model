They are designed to achieve near-Shannon-limit performance, which means they approach the theoretical maximum efficiency for data transmission over noisy communication channels. Turbo codes utilize iterative decoding techniques, which contribute to their computational practicality and effectiveness. These codes are widely employed in various communication systems, including wireless and satellite communications, due to their robust error-correcting capabilities and ability to enhance the reliability of data transmission. Overall, TURBO CODES represent a pivotal advancement in the development of efficient and practical error-correcting solutions for modern communication technologies.\",7\r\n369,ITERATIVE DECODING,\"Iterative Decoding is a concept in information theory that refers to a decoding process in which multiple decoders exchange and iteratively refine their estimates of bit values. This process continues until a consensus is reached among the decoders. The method is designed to improve the accuracy of decoding by leveraging repeated exchanges and refinements, making it a fundamental technique in the field of information theory.\",2\r\n362,BERROU,\"A researcher who, in 1993, proposed combining two interleaved convolutional codes with a parallel cooperative decoder to achieve better performance\"\"\",1\r\n370,PARALLEL COOPERATIVE DECODER,\"A decoder structure where two decoders work in parallel, exchanging information to improve decoding accuracy\"\"\",1\r\n473,JOINT AEP,\"The **JOINT AEP**, or **Joint Asymptotic Equipartition Property**, is a fundamental concept in information theory.
