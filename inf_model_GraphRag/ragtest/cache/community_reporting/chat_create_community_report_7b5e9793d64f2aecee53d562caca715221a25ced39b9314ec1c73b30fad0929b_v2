They are designed to achieve near-Shannon-limit performance, which means they approach the theoretical maximum efficiency for data transmission over noisy communication channels. Turbo codes utilize iterative decoding techniques, which contribute to their computational practicality and effectiveness. These codes are widely employed in various communication systems, including wireless and satellite communications, due to their robust error-correcting capabilities and ability to enhance the reliability of data transmission. Overall, TURBO CODES represent a pivotal advancement in the development of efficient and practical error-correcting solutions for modern communication technologies.\",7\r\n21,RATE DISTORTION FUNCTION,\"The **Rate Distortion Function** is a fundamental concept in information theory that quantifies the relationship between the rate of information transmission and the level of distortion. It defines the minimum achievable rate required to represent or transmit a source while ensuring that the distortion does not exceed a specified level. This function is essential for understanding the trade-offs between data compression and fidelity in communication systems. As discussed in Chapter 10, the Rate Distortion Function characterizes the minimum rate necessary to achieve a given distortion level, providing a theoretical framework for optimizing information transmission under constraints. In summary, the Rate Distortion Function measures the minimum rate at which information can be transmitted or represented while maintaining distortion below a predetermined threshold, making it a critical tool in the study of information theory.\",12\r\n466,BERNOULLI(P) SOURCE,,2\r\n463,INFORMATION RATE DISTORTION FUNCTION,\"A function that represents the minimum achievable rate for a given distortion, equivalent to the rate distortion function\"\"\",1\r\n498,PINKSTON,Pinkston is credited with a result related to rate distortion functions and distortion metrics,1\r\n500,HAMMING DISTORTION,\"Hamming distortion is a measure of the difference between two strings of equal length, defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different\",1\r\n369,ITERATIVE DECODING,\"Iterative Decoding is a concept in information theory that refers to a decoding process in which multiple decoders exchange and iteratively refine their estimates of bit values.
