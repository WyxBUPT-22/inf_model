They are designed to achieve near-Shannon-limit performance, which means they approach the theoretical maximum efficiency for data transmission over noisy communication channels. Turbo codes utilize iterative decoding techniques, which contribute to their computational practicality and effectiveness. These codes are widely employed in various communication systems, including wireless and satellite communications, due to their robust error-correcting capabilities and ability to enhance the reliability of data transmission. Overall, TURBO CODES represent a pivotal advancement in the development of efficient and practical error-correcting solutions for modern communication technologies.\",7\r\n21,RATE DISTORTION FUNCTION,\"The **Rate Distortion Function** is a fundamental concept in information theory that quantifies the relationship between the rate of information transmission and the level of distortion. It defines the minimum achievable rate required to represent or transmit a source while ensuring that the distortion does not exceed a specified level. This function is essential for understanding the trade-offs between data compression and fidelity in communication systems. As discussed in Chapter 10, the Rate Distortion Function characterizes the minimum rate necessary to achieve a given distortion level, providing a theoretical framework for optimizing information transmission under constraints.
