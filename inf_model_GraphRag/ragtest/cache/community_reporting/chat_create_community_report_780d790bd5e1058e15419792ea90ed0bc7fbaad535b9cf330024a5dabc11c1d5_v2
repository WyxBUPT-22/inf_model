It operates by dividing time into discrete slots, with each user allocated a specific time slot during which they are permitted to transmit data. While other users wait for their designated slots, this method ensures orderly and synchronized communication. TDMA is particularly suited for fixed groups, as it allows for flexibility in handling scenarios where some time slots may remain empty or certain users may be offline. This approach optimizes bandwidth usage and minimizes interference, making it a reliable and structured method for managing multiple communication channels.\",4\r\n734,FDMA,\"FDMA, or Frequency-Division Multiple Access, is a communication system and multiplexing technique designed to facilitate efficient data transmission among multiple users. In this system, the total available bandwidth is divided into distinct, non-overlapping frequency bands, with each band assigned to a specific user for transmission. This approach ensures that users can communicate simultaneously without interference, as each operates on a unique frequency. FDMA is particularly well-suited for fixed groups of users, allowing for flexibility in communication by permitting some time slots to remain empty or enabling certain users to be offline without disrupting the overall system. This combination of frequency division and adaptability makes FDMA a reliable and structured method for managing multiple communication channels.\",3\r\n732,CDMA,\"CDMA, or Code-Division Multiple Access, is a communication technology designed to enable multiple senders to transmit data simultaneously over a shared communication channel. It achieves this by partitioning encoding by sender and processing decoding individually at the receiver end. One of the key advantages of CDMA is its ability to achieve the entire capacity region, allowing new users to join the network seamlessly without requiring changes to the encodings of current users.

TDMA operates by dividing the available time into discrete slots, allowing multiple users to share the same frequency channel by transmitting in their allocated time intervals. In contrast, FDMA divides the available frequency spectrum into separate channels, assigning each user a unique frequency band for communication. Both techniques are designed to facilitate communication for fixed groups of users and share similar limitations in user management, such as constraints on the number of users that can be supported simultaneously.

CDMA allows multiple users to occupy the same channel simultaneously by assigning unique codes to each user, enabling them to transmit data concurrently. In contrast, TDMA divides the channel into distinct time slots, allocating each user a specific time interval to transmit their data, ensuring no overlap.

CDMA operates through code division, where users share the same frequency band but are distinguished by unique codes, allowing simultaneous communication. In contrast, FDMA uses frequency division, allocating separate frequency bands to individual users to enable communication without interference. While both technologies serve the same purpose of facilitating multiple user access in communication systems, they differ significantly in their approach to capacity and user management. CDMA is often noted for its efficient use of bandwidth and ability to support more users in a given frequency range, whereas FDMA provides a straightforward allocation of dedicated frequency channels.
