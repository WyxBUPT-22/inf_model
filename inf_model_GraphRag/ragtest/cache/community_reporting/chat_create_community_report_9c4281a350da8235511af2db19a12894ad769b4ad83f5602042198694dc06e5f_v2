It is defined as the probability that the estimated random variable \\( \\hat{X} \\) does not equal the true random variable \\( X \\), or equivalently, the probability that the decoded message differs from the originally sent message. This probability is bounded by the Fano Inequality, which provides a theoretical limit on the error probability based on the entropy of the system. In practical applications, such as communication over a Gaussian channel, the error probability is minimized through the use of advanced techniques like random codes and joint typicality decoding. These methods aim to reduce the likelihood of decoding errors, ensuring more reliable transmission of information. Overall, the error probability serves as a critical metric for evaluating the performance and robustness of communication systems.\",7\r\n334,JOINT TYPICALITY DECODING,\"**Joint Typicality Decoding** is a decoding rule employed in the context of information theory, specifically in the proofs of fundamental theorems related to channel capacity and coding. It operates by identifying a codeword that is jointly typical with the received sequence, which is then selected as the transmitted codeword. This method is integral to the proof of the **channel capacity theorem**, where it ensures reliable communication by leveraging the concept of joint typicality. Additionally, **Joint Typicality Decoding** is also applied in the proof of the **channel coding theorem** for Gaussian channels, where it plays a crucial role in achieving low error probability.
