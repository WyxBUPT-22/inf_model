This type of communication channel is widely used in broadcasting scenarios, where the sender disseminates data, signals, or messages to a broad audience. The receivers in a broadcast channel may experience varying noise levels, which can affect the quality or clarity of the received information. Additionally, the receivers may differ in their capacities and understanding, leading to diverse interpretations or processing of the transmitted data. \n\nIn the context of information theory, the study of broadcast channels focuses on analyzing and determining the **capacity region**, which defines the set of achievable rates at which information can be reliably transmitted from the sender to the multiple receivers. This analysis is crucial for optimizing communication efficiency and understanding the limitations of such channels.
