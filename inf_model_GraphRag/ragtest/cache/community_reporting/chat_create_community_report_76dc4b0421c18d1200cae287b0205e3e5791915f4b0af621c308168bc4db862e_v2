It specifically deals with correlated sources, often denoted as X and Y, and explores the rate-distortion trade-offs involved in encoding these sources separately without direct communication between the encoders. While one description emphasizes the presence of distortions in both X and Y, another highlights the scenario of zero distortion. These perspectives can be reconciled by understanding that the Slepian-Wolf problem encompasses both cases: it provides a framework for analyzing the rate requirements for lossless (zero distortion) and lossy (with distortions) compression of correlated sources.
