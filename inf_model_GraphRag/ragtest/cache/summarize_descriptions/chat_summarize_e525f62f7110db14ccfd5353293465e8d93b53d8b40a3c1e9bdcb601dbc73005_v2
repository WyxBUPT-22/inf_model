It refers to the smallest number of positions in which any two code words differ. This parameter is crucial as it directly influences the error-detecting and error-correcting capabilities of a code. A larger minimum distance generally indicates a stronger ability to correct errors, making it a key metric in the design and analysis of coding systems. Thus, the minimum distance serves as both a theoretical concept and a practical tool in ensuring the reliability and efficiency of data transmission and storage.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484205, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 308, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
