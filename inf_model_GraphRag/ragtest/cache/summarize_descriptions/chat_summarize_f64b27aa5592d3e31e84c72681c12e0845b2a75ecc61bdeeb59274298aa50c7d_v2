It is modeled as an additive channel where the output is the modulo-2 sum of the input and an independent binary random variable. This model implies that every possible output sequence has a positive probability for any given input sequence, reflecting the channel's probabilistic nature. However, despite this property, the BSC has a zero-error capacity of 0, meaning it is impossible to transmit information without any possibility of error. The BSC is frequently referenced in the context of information theory due to its utility in analyzing error correction, channel capacity, and communication reliability.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484207, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 350, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
