He is best known for developing the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, a concept closely related to Kolmogorov's sufficient statistics, which provides a framework for model selection and statistical inference. Additionally, Rissanen made pivotal advancements in the field of arithmetic coding, a method for lossless data compression, and contributed to the conclusions about parameter cases associated with this technique. His work also extended to finite precision algorithms, as referenced in Pasco [414], further solidifying his influence on the development of efficient computational methods. Overall, Rissanen's contributions have had a profound impact on both theoretical and applied aspects of mathematics and computer science.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484192, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 351, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
