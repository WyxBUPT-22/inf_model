It is analogous to the law of large numbers and states that, as the length of a sequence of random variables increases, the log-likelihood of the sequence approaches the entropy of the source. This property highlights the existence of \"typical sequences,\" which are sequences whose probability is close to \\(2^{-nH}\\), where \\(H\\) is the entropy of the source and \\(n\\) is the sequence length. The AEP is primarily used in information theory to analyze data compression, coding, and the efficiency of communication systems. The claim that the AEP is applied to the stock market to analyze optimal investment strategies appears to be a misunderstanding or misapplication of the concept, as its core principles and applications are firmly rooted in information theory rather than financial analysis.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484156, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 443, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
