This concept is central to understanding the limits of data transmission and is closely associated with Shannon's theorem, which defines the theoretical upper bound for reliable communication. The channel capacity is mathematically expressed through formulas such as \\( C = W \\log(1 + P/N_0W) \\) for general communication channels and \\( C = (1/2) \\log(1 + P/N) \\) for Gaussian channels, where \\( W \\) represents bandwidth, \\( P \\) is the signal power, and \\( N \\) or \\( N_0 \\) denotes noise power. These formulas highlight the relationship between bandwidth, signal strength, and noise in determining the maximum achievable transmission rate. While some descriptions emphasize the absence of error and others focus on low error probability, the overarching principle remains consistent: channel capacity quantifies the optimal performance of a communication system under given constraints. Additionally, the concept is relevant in broader contexts, such as its application in source coding and game theory, further underscoring its significance in both theoretical and practical domains of information science.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484155, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 243, "prompt_tokens": 323, "total_tokens": 566, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
