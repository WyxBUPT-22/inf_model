They are credited with providing proofs of the asymptotic optimality of both the LZ77 and LZ78 encoding algorithms. Their work demonstrated that the compression rates of these algorithms converge to the entropy for traversing sources, establishing their efficiency in data compression. A key aspect of their proof for the LZ77 algorithm involves the application of a simple lemma discovered by Kac, which states that the average length of time to wait for a specific character is the reciprocal of its probability. Through their research, Wyner and Ziv have solidified the theoretical foundations of these widely used compression techniques, highlighting their practical and theoretical significance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484240, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
