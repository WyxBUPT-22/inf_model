It serves as a foundational example of error correction techniques, illustrating basic principles common to most codes. The primary purpose of the Hamming Code is to recover original messages despite information loss or corruption during transmission. Specifically, it is designed to correct up to one error in a 7-bit code word. The code is characterized by its parameters (7,4,3), where 7 represents the block length, 4 denotes the number of information bits, and 3 signifies the minimum distance between code words. This combination of simplicity and efficiency makes the Hamming Code a widely studied and applied method in the field of error detection and correction.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484206, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 263, "total_tokens": 412, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
