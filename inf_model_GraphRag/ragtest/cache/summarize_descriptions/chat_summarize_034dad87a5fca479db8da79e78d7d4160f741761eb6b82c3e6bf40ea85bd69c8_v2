It demonstrates that correlated sources can be encoded separately but decoded jointly, achieving efficient compression rates. The method proves that the total rate \\( R = H(X,Y) \\) is sufficient for this process, where \\( H(X,Y) \\) represents the joint entropy of the sources. Additionally, the compression rates are based on conditional entropy, which allows for optimal performance even when the sources are not directly communicating during the encoding phase. This approach is foundational in the field of distributed source coding, enabling efficient data compression and transmission in scenarios where sources are correlated but independently encoded.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484253, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 325, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
