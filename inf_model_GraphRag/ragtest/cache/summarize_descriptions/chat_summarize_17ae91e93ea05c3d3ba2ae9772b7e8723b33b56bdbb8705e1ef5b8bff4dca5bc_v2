He is credited with formulating the equation \\( S = k \\ln W \\), which establishes a fundamental relationship between thermodynamic entropy (\\( S \\)) and the logarithm of the number of microscopic states (\\( W \\)). This equation, a cornerstone of statistical mechanics, is so significant that it is engraved on his tombstone as a testament to his legacy.
