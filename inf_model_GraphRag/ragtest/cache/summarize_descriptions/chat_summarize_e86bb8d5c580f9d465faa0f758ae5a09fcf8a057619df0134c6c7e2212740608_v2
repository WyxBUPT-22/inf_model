It defines the maximum rate, known as the channel capacity, at which information can be transmitted through a noisy channel with arbitrarily low error probability. The theorem states that all transmission rates below this channel capacity are achievable with negligible error probability, while rates above the capacity are not. This principle underscores the possibility of reliable communication even in the presence of noise, provided the code rate remains within the channel's capacity. The Channel Coding Theorem is a cornerstone of information theory, providing a theoretical foundation for the design and analysis of communication systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484203, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 381, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
