It operates by identifying a codeword that is jointly typical with the received sequence, which is then selected as the transmitted codeword. This method is integral to the proof of the **channel capacity theorem**, where it ensures reliable communication by leveraging the concept of joint typicality. Additionally, **Joint Typicality Decoding** is also applied in the proof of the **channel coding theorem** for Gaussian channels, where it plays a crucial role in achieving low error probability. Together, these applications highlight its significance in establishing the theoretical foundations of channel capacity and coding efficiency.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484204, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 146, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 347, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
