Arimoto developed an iterative algorithm for computing channel capacity, which has become a foundational tool in the field. Additionally, Arimoto made notable advancements in the calculation of rate-distortion functions, specifically for general independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sources and arbitrary distortion measures. This work includes the development of an iterative algorithm for determining the rate-distortion function, which has been widely referenced and utilized in subsequent research. Overall, Arimoto's contributions have had a lasting impact on the mathematical foundations of information theory.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484216, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 345, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
