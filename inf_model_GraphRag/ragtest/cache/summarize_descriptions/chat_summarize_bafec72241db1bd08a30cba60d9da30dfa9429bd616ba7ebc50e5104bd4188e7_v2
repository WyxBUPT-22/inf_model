It constructs prefix codes by assigning codewords to the values of a random variable X, where the length of each codeword is determined by the probability of the corresponding value. This approach ensures that more probable values are represented by shorter codewords, aligning with the principles of entropy bounds in binary distributions. While the Shannon Code is effective in achieving data compression, it is often considered less efficient compared to the Huffman code, which optimizes codeword lengths more precisely. Overall, the Shannon Code serves as a foundational technique in information theory for encoding data in a manner that balances efficiency and simplicity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484188, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
