Together, they co-authored the groundbreaking Lempel-Ziv algorithm, a pivotal development in data compression technology. Their work, published in influential articles in 1977 and 1978, introduced and popularized the adaptive dictionary-based scheme for data compression. This algorithm has since become a cornerstone in the field, widely referenced and utilized for its efficiency and innovation.
