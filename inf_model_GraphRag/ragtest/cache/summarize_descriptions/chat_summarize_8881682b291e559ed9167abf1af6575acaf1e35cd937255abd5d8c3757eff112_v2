It generalizes the Asymptotic Equipartition Property (AEP) specifically for ergodic sources, providing a deeper understanding of the entropy of stochastic processes. This theorem is particularly significant in the context of ergodic processes, where it establishes a connection between the probabilistic behavior of sequences and their information-theoretic properties. Overall, the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman Theorem serves as a cornerstone in the study of information theory, offering insights into the entropy and asymptotic behavior of stochastic systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484178, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 353, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
