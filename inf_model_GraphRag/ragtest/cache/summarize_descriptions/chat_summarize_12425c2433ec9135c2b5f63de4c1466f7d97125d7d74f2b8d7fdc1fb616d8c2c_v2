This property, known as the Markov property, defines a Markov chain as a type of Markov process. It is often described as a stochastic process that undergoes transitions from one state to another according to specific probabilistic rules, typically represented by a transition probability matrix. \n\nMarkov chains are widely used in various applications, including maximum entropy calculations and illustrating theoretical concepts in probability. They are referenced extensively in academic texts, with mentions across numerous pages (e.g., 35, 36, 39, 40, 47, 52, 71-100, 144, 206, 258, 294, 295, 423, 458, 470, 497, 499, 578-580, and 584). A first-order binary Markov chain is a specific example used to simplify and demonstrate the principles of Markov processes. \n\nIn summary, a Markov chain is a stochastic process defined by its dependence on the current state rather than its history, making it a powerful tool for modeling systems with probabilistic transitions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484169, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 250, "prompt_tokens": 456, "total_tokens": 706, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
