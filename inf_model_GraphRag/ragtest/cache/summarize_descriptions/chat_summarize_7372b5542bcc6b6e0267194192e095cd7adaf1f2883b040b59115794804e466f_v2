It serves as a mathematical criterion to determine whether the lengths of codewords in a prefix code are valid and whether such a code can be constructed. The inequality is essential for verifying the possibility of assigning nodes in a constructed tree, which is a key step in designing prefix codes. First proved by **McMillan** and later by **Karush**, the Kraft Inequality also guarantees the existence of **uniquely decodable codes**, making it a cornerstone result in the field. Its applications span both theoretical and practical aspects of coding, ensuring that codes can be efficiently designed and decoded without ambiguity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484188, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 244, "total_tokens": 395, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
