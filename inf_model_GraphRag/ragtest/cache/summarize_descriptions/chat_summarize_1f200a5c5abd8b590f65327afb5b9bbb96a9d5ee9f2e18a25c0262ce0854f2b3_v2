It was developed by Claude Shannon and Robert Fano, and it serves as a foundational technique in the field of information theory. The Shannon-Fano code is also recognized as a precursor to more advanced coding methods, such as arithmetic coding, which builds upon its principles. This approach aims to efficiently encode data by assigning shorter codes to more frequently occurring symbols, thereby optimizing compression. While some sources attribute its development to Elias, it is widely acknowledged that Shannon and Fano were the primary contributors to this coding method.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484244, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 170, "total_tokens": 294, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
