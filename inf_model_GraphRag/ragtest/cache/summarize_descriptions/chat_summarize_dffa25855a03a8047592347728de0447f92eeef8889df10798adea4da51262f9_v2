They are designed to achieve near-Shannon-limit performance, which means they approach the theoretical maximum efficiency for data transmission over noisy communication channels. Turbo codes utilize iterative decoding techniques, which contribute to their computational practicality and effectiveness. These codes are widely employed in various communication systems, including wireless and satellite communications, due to their robust error-correcting capabilities and ability to enhance the reliability of data transmission. Overall, TURBO CODES represent a pivotal advancement in the development of efficient and practical error-correcting solutions for modern communication technologies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484149, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 333, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
