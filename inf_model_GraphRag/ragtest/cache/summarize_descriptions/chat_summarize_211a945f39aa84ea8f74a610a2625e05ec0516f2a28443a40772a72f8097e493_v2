It is defined as the probability that the estimated random variable \\( \\hat{X} \\) does not equal the true random variable \\( X \\), or equivalently, the probability that the decoded message differs from the originally sent message. This probability is bounded by the Fano Inequality, which provides a theoretical limit on the error probability based on the entropy of the system. In practical applications, such as communication over a Gaussian channel, the error probability is minimized through the use of advanced techniques like random codes and joint typicality decoding. These methods aim to reduce the likelihood of decoding errors, ensuring more reliable transmission of information. Overall, the error probability serves as a critical metric for evaluating the performance and robustness of communication systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484166, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 402, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
