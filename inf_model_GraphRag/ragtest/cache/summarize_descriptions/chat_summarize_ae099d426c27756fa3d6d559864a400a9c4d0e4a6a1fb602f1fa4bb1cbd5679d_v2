In this model, inputs are either received unchanged or transformed into the next letter in a predefined sequence. This behavior is analogous to a typewriter that introduces noise into the transmission process. The channel is characterized by its capacity, which is quantified as **log13 bits per transmission**, indicating the maximum rate at which information can be reliably transmitted through the channel. Overall, the Noisy Typewriter Channel serves as a theoretical framework for understanding communication systems where inputs may be altered in a predictable yet noisy manner.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484204, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 311, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
