CDMA operates through code division, where users share the same frequency band but are distinguished by unique codes, allowing simultaneous communication. In contrast, FDMA uses frequency division, allocating separate frequency bands to individual users to enable communication without interference. While both technologies serve the same purpose of facilitating multiple user access in communication systems, they differ significantly in their approach to capacity and user management. CDMA is often noted for its efficient use of bandwidth and ability to support more users in a given frequency range, whereas FDMA provides a straightforward allocation of dedicated frequency channels. Together, these technologies represent foundational methods for managing communication resources in diverse network environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484363, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 344, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
