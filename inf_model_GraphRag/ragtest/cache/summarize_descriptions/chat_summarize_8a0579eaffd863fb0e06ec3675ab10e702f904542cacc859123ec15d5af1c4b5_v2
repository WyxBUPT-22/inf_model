As more input characters are observed, the interval progressively shrinks, allowing for efficient encoding. This method approximates the nH bits of \\( x^n \\), effectively representing the n bits of \\( x^n \\). Arithmetic coding plays a fundamental role in Shannon-Fano coding and has been extensively analyzed by researchers such as Jelinek. Initially proposed by Rissanen and Pasco, the technique was later generalized by Langdon and Rissanen, further enhancing its applicability and efficiency in data compression. Overall, Arithmetic Coding is a pivotal procedure in information theory, combining theoretical insights with practical utility.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484193, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 384, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
