The **stationary distribution** of a Markov chain describes its long-term behavior, representing the equilibrium state that the chain approaches over time. This distribution is derived from the transition probability matrix of the Markov chain, which governs the probabilities of moving between states. In essence, the stationary distribution provides a probabilistic snapshot of the system's steady-state, where the probabilities of being in each state remain constant over time, regardless of the initial state. Together, the Markov chain and its stationary distribution offer a framework for understanding the long-term dynamics and equilibrium properties of systems modeled by such processes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484352, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 171, "total_tokens": 309, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
