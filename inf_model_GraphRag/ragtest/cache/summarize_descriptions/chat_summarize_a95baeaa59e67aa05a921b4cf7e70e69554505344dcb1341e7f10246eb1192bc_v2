It is characterized by the presence of additive Gaussian noise, which follows a normal distribution, often attributed to the central limit theorem. This model is particularly significant in network information theory due to its strong physical background and the ability to provide specific, easily interpretable results. \n\nThe Gaussian Channel is defined as a time-discrete channel where the output signal is the sum of the input signal and Gaussian noise. It is employed to study key aspects of communication systems, including information transmission capacity, error probabilities, and the impact of noise on signal integrity. The channel is also subject to power constraints and noise variance, which are critical parameters in calculating channel capacity and error probability.\n\nIn practical applications, the Gaussian Channel simulates various real-world communication systems, such as radio and satellite communications, where noise is a significant factor. Additionally, the model is discussed in the context of feedback, exploring how feedback mechanisms influence the channel's performance and capacity. Overall, the Gaussian Channel serves as a classic and versatile tool in information theory, providing insights into the behavior of communication systems under noisy conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false}, "sexual": {"filtered": false}, "violence": {"filtered": false}, "jailbreak": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}, "profanity": {"filtered": false, "detected": false}}}], "created": 1745484138, "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 240, "prompt_tokens": 360, "total_tokens": 600, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": null, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
