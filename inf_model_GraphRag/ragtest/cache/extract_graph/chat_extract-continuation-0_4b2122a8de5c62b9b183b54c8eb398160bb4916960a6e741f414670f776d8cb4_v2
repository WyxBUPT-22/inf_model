例子是流行于India的问候语电报，有一个标准的问候语集合，例如“25：圣诞节快乐”和“26：愿新婚夫妇沐浴在上帝最美好的祝福中”。当人们希望发送问候时，只需确定指定的数字，由此在目的地生成实际的问候语。  \n\n基于自适应字典式方案的思想直到 Ziv 和 Lempel 于 1977 年和 1978 年发表文章后才被人们广泛采用。这两篇文章描述了算法的两个不同版本。我们称为LZ77或滑动窗Lempel-Ziv算法与LZ78或树结构Lempel-Ziv算法。（有时，它们各自分别简称为LZ1与LZ2。）  \n\n下面首先叙述两种情形各自的基本算法，并给出一些简单的变形。过后，我们将证明算法的最优性，并在最后讨论一些实际的问题。Lempel-Ziv算法的关键思想是将字符串解析成一个个词组，并利用指针替换词组，而这些指针指向过去出现相同字符串的位置。两种算法的区别在于各算法允许的可能匹配位置（和匹配长度）集合之间的差别。  \n\n# 13. 4. 1 带滑动窗口的 Lempel-Ziv 算法  \n\n在1977年的文章中提出的算法，其主要思想是在一个过去字符窗口的任何地方通过查找最长匹配进行字符串编码，同时利用指向窗中匹配位置和匹配长度的指针表示字符串。这个基本算法有着许多形式的变种，我们只描述其中由Storer和 Szymanski[507]给出的一种。  \n\n假定有限字母表的字符串 $x_{1},x_{2}$ ,-需要被压缩。字符串 $x_{1},x_{2},\\cdots,x_{n}$ 的解析(parsing) $s$ 是将该字符串划分成若干词组，用逗号隔开。设W为窗口的长度。此时算法描述如下：假定已经将字符串压缩到时刻 $i-1$ ，然后，为了找到下一个词组，先计算最大的 $k$ ，使得对某个 $j$ $i-1-W\\leqslant$ ${j\\leqslant i-1}$ ，长度为 $\\pmb{k}$ 并起始于 $x_{j}$ 的字符串等于起始于 $x_{i}$ 的字符串(长度为 $k$ )即对任意的 $\\mathbb{0}{\\leqslant}l{<}k$ 有 $\\boldsymbol{x}_{j+l}=\\boldsymbol{x}_{i+l})$ 。于是，下一个词组的长度为 $\\pmb{k}$ （即 $x_{i}\\cdots x_{i+k-1})$ ，且表示为二元对 $(P,L)$ ，其中 $P$ 为匹配的起始位置， $L$ 为匹配的长度。如果在窗口中没有找到匹配，则下一个字符将无压缩地被发送。为区分这两种情形，需要一个标识位，因此，词组有两种类型： $(F,P,L)$ 或 $(F,C)$ ，其中$C$ 表示未压缩的字符。  \n\n注意，（指针，长度)对的目标表示可能延伸超出窗口，从而导致与新的词组重叠。在理论上，这样的匹配可以任意长。而在实际中，最大词组长度限制为不能超过某个参数。  \n\n例如，若 $W=4$ ，字符串为ABBABBABBBAABABA，起初窗口为空，该字符串可以解析如「：A,B,B,ABBABB,BA,A,BA,BA，用“指针\"序列表示就是：(0,A)，(0,B)，（1,1,1)，（1,3,6)，(1,4,2)，（1,1,1），（1,3,2)，（1,2,2),其中当没有匹配时标识位为0，有匹配时标识位为1，并且匹配的位置是从窗口的末端向后开始测量的。（在此例中，使用二元对 $(P,L)$ 表示窗口\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INDIA<|>GEO<|>India is a country where a standard set of greeting telegrams is popular,
