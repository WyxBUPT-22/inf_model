服从[0,1]上的均匀分布，构造出这个分布。对于Bernoulli $(\\theta)$ 分布，具有 $k$ 个1的序列 $x_{1},x_{2},\\cdots,x_{n}$ 的概率为 $\\theta^{k}(1-\\theta)^{n-k}$ 。因此，序列的混合概率为  \n\n$$\n{}\\hat{p}(x_{1},x_{2},\\cdots,x_{n})=\\int_{0}^{1}\\theta^{k}(1-\\theta)^{n-k}{\\sf d}\\theta\\underline{{\\triangle}}A(n,k)\n$$\n\n利用分部积分，令 ${\\pmb u}=({\\bf1}-\\theta)^{n-k}$ 和 $\\mathrm{d}v=\\theta^{k}\\mathrm{d}\\theta$ ，我们有  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{{\\displaystyle{\\int_{0}^{1}\\theta^{k}(1-\\theta)^{n-k}\\mathrm{d}\\theta}=\\left[\\frac{1}{k+1}\\theta^{k+1}(1-\\theta)^{n-k}\\right]_{0}^{1}}}}\\

\n\n$$\nA\\left({n,k}\\right)={\\frac{n-k}{k+1}}A\\left({n,k+1}\\right)\n$$\n\n又由于 $A(n,n)=\\int_{0}^{1}\\theta^{n}\\mathrm{d}\\theta=\\frac{1}{n+1}$ 通过递归容易证明  \n\n$$\n\\phi(\\l_{x_{1}},\\l_{x_{2}},\\cdots,\\l_{x_{n}})=A(\\l_{n},k)=\\frac{1}{n+1}\\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{k}}\n$$\n\n由此，混合分布的码字长度满足

\n\n$$\nl(x_{1},x_{2},\\cdots,x_{n}){\\leqslant}n H{\\Bigl(}{\\frac{k}{n}}{\\Bigr)}+{\\frac{1}{2}}\\log n-{\\frac{1}{2}}\\log{\\Bigl(}\\pi{\\frac{k}{n}}{\\frac{\\left(n-k\\right)}{n}}{\\Bigr)}+2\n$$\n\n若实际信源服从 $\\operatorname{Bernoulli}\\left({\\frac{k}{n}}\\right)$ ，则最优码的码长需要 $n H(k/n)$

个字符中1的个数。利用式(13-38)，我们有  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{q(x_{i+1}\\l\\vert x^{i})=\\displaystyle\\frac{q(x^{i},1)}{q(x^{i})}}}\\

{{\\quad\\quad=\\displaystyle\\frac{k_{i}+1}{i+2}}}\\end{array}\n$$\n\n此即在给定θ的均匀先验下1的贝叶斯后验概率，称为下一个字符出现概率的\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
