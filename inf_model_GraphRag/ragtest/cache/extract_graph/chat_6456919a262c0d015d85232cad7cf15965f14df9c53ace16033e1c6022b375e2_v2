�定将嘉宾模拟成一台计算机，根据指定的文章确定猜测选择。此时，利用该机器，以及猜测次数的数据列，可以重构一个英语文本。只要将该计算机启动，并假设在任何位置上所需的猜测次数均为k，选取机子的第k次猜测的字母为下一个出现的字母即可。于是，猜测次数的信息量正好是英文文本的信息量，猜测序列的熵也正好是英文文本的熵。只要我们假设所选取的样本是独立的，就可以界定猜测次数序列的熵。从而，该实验数中直方图的熵就为猜测序列的熵的上界。该实验是香农于1950 年给出的(Shannon[482])。他获得的英文的熵为1.3比特/字符。  \n\n2.博弈估计。在此游戏中，让嘉宾在一篇英语范文中猜测下一个字母出现的字母。这与前面的不同之处在于，允许有一个比猜测更为精细的评判等级。与赛马的情形一样，最优的博弈策略是与下一个字母出现的条件概率成比例。猜对了字母的机会收益是：27兑1。  \n\n由于一连串的分步下注等价于下注一个序列的所有项，因此，在n个字母之后可得到所得的收益总额为  \n\n$$\nS_{n}=(27)^{n}b(X_{1},X_{2},\\cdots,X_{n})\n$$\n\n于是，经过n轮下注，相对收益的对数期望满足  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}{{\\displaystyle E\\frac1n\\log

27-logS,依概率1收敛于H(&)。文献[131]中给出一个试验：利用 Dumas Malone 的小说《Jefferson the Virginian》为范文(香农使用的信源 Little,Brown,Boston,1948），由12个参赛者针对75个样本字母进行实验，所得到的估计结果仍然是英文的熵为1.34 比特/字符。  \n\n# 要点  \n\n$W({\\bf b},{\\bf
