TH_V_W_LS_N TH_SS_NT_NC_.香农的关于信息论的原创工作的某些灵感来自于第二次世界大战期间他在密码学的工作。密码学的数学理论以及密码学与语言的熵之间的关系也在香农的文章[481]中作了详细论述。  \n\n语言随机模型在某些语音识别系统中也起到了关键作用。经常使用的模型是三字符模型（也就是2阶马尔可夫单词模型），它是估计在已知前面两个单词的条件下来估计出下一个单词出现的概率。从语音信号中获得的信息与模型结合可以产生一个最酷似于在被观测的语音中的词汇。虽然我们还不能清楚地看出随机模型是否有能力将支配自然语言(如英语)的复杂语法规则进行整合，但它们在语音识别中吻合的程度已经好得令人吃惊。  \n\n我们可以将这种技巧使用在其他信源，比如，语音信号和图像信号等，估计它们的嫡率。关于这些内容的风趣的介绍可在Lucky［366］中找到。  \n\n# 6.5数据压缩与博弈  \n\n本节证明一个优秀的马民也是一个优秀的数据压缩器。借此说明博弈与数据压缩的直接联系。其实，马民愿意将大笔资金下注的任何一个序列必定是可以被大幅压缩的序列。将马民视为数据压缩器的想法基于这样的事实：马民的每个下注策略可以认为是对数据的概率分布给出的估计。一个优秀的马民必然得到该概率分布的优秀估计。我们可以利用对概率分布的这种估计进行算术编码（13.3节）。这是下述的方案的基本思想。  \n\n假设马民有一个在机械性能上完全相同的虚拟双胞胎，其专门管数据解压缩。该李生兄弟将与现实中的马民兄弟有同样的下注策略(因而投资相同的钱)。于是在所有可能的结果构成的序列集合中，对于一个给定的序列，按照字典排序法，有一些序列小于该给定的序列，马民从所有这些序列上获得的累计资金将用作该给定序列的压缩数据。解码器将利用虚拟的马民对所有可能的策略进行模拟下注，从中搜索出这样一个序列，从所有比它小的序列获得的累计资金正好就等于该压缩数据。将此序列作为压缩数据的解压序列。  \n\n令 X1,X2，,X，为一个待压缩的随机变量序列。不失一般性，假设这些随机变量是二值的。于是，对一个序列的博弈可以定义为如下的一系列分步下注策略  \n\n$$\nb(\\O_{k+1}\\mid\\O_{x_{1}},\\O_{x_{2}},\\cdots,\\O_{x_{k}})\\geqslant0,\\sum_{\\scriptstyle x_{k+1}}b(\\O_{k+1}\\mid\\O_{x_{1}},\\O_{x_{2}},\\cdots,\\O_{x_{k}})=1\n$$\n\n其中b（k+1|,2，,x)为基于历史观测数据1,x2，,k之下，在k时刻时下注在事件Xk+1= xk+1的资金比例。假设均匀的机会收益是2 兑1，那么，博弈序列所得的相对收益就是最后一步所得的相对收益 $S_{n}$ 按如下公式计算
