句话概括这两个结果的证明过程。数据压缩定理来源于AEP，表明全部信源序列存在一个拥有了绝大部分概率的“小型”的子集（大小为 $2^{n H}$ )，根据这个子集使用 $H$ 比特/字符并以很小的误差概率来表示这个信源。数据传输定理基于联合的AEP；它依据的事实是：对于大的分组长度，信道的输出序列非常有可能与输入码字是联合典型的，而任何其他码字是联合典型的概率约为 $2^{-n I}$ 。因而，我们可以使用大约 $2^{n I}$ 个码字而保持可忽略的误差概率。信源信道分离定理说明，我们可以独立地设计信源码和信道码，然后结合两者的结果以达到最优的效果。  \n\n# 要点  \n\n信息容量可区分的输人信号数量的对数值由下面等式给出  \n\n# 例子  \n\n二元对称信道： $C=1-H(p)_{\\circ}$   \n二元擦除信道： $c=1-a_{0}$

 \n\n信道编码定理所有小于信道容量C的码率都是可达的，而所有大于信道容量的码率是不可达的；也就是说，对任意的码率R<C，存在误差概率满足x（m）→0的一个（2，n）码序列。反之如果码率R>C，那么入将远离0。  \n\n反馈容量对于离散无记忆信道，反馈并不能增加信道容量，即CBC。  \n\n信源信道定理如果随机过程的率H>C，则该过程不能通过离散无记忆信道破可靠地传输。相反，如果随机过程满足AEP，且H<C，则信源可以被可靠地传输。  \n\n# 习题  \n\n7.1输出的预处理。如果一个统计学家面对具有转移概率为 p(ylx)且信道容量C=maxp(x)I(X,Y)的通信信道，他会对输出做出很有帮助的预处理：Y=g(Y)，并且断定这样做能够严格地改进容量。
