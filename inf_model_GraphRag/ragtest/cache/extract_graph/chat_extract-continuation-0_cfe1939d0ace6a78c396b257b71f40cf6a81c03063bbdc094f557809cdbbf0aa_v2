\n\n在设计出的编码算法当中，经历了很多年，没有一种编码算法能够接近香农信道容量定理中所给出的界。对一个交叉概率为p的二元对称信道，我们需要一种码，它能在长度为 n且占 n(1-H(p))个信息比特的分组中纠正多达 np 个错误。例如，在长度为 n 的分组中,前面提及的重复码可以纠正多达 n /2 个错误,但是它的码率随着 n 的增大而趋于0。在 1972年以前，对于能够在长度为 $\\pmb{n}$ 的分组中纠正 $_{n\\alpha}$ 个错误的编码，它们的码率都渐近于0。而到1972年，Justesen［301]设计出了-类码,具有正的渐近码率和正的渐近最小距离，并且都与分组长度成正比。  \n\n到了1993年，Berrou等人在文章［57］中提出了下列观点：将两个交织卷积码与一个并行协作的译码器组合起来能获得远比此前任何码更好的效果。每个译码器将自身对每个比特值的“意见”反馈给另一个译码器，并利用该译码器的意见来帮助确定自身的这个比特值。这种迭代过程不停地重复，直到两个译码器都对比特的取值达成共识为止。令人惊讶的是，这个迭代程序对于许多信道都能在接近于容量的码率下进行有效地译码。这也重新提升了学者们对RobertGallager在其学位论文［231，232］中引人的低密度奇偶性校验（low-densityparity check，LDPC)码的研究兴趣。1997 年，MacKay与Neal[368］证明了对于LDPC码，选代的消息传输算法(类似于用来译解turbo码的算法)可以使码率以很高的概率达到信道容量。至今，turbo码与LDPC码仍然是研究的热点，并且应用在无线通信和卫星通信信道中。  \n\n# 7.12 反馈容量  \n\n带反馈的信道如图7-13所示。假定所有接收到的字符立即以无噪声的方式传输回发送者，这样，发送者可以利用它们来决定下面将要发送哪一个字符。反馈会给我们带来好处吗？令人吃惊的是，回答为否定。现在来证明。我们把 $(2^{n R},n)$ 反馈码（feedbackcode）定义为一个映射序列 $x_{i}(W,Y^{i-1})$ 和一个译码函数序列 $g:{\\mathcal{V}}^{n}{\\rightarrow}\\{1,2,\\cdots,2^{n R}\\}$ ，其中 $x_{i}$ 是仅与消息 $\\scriptstyle W\\in2^{n R}$ 和先前接收到的值 $Y_{1},Y_{2},\\cdots,Y_{i-1}$ 的函数。于是，当W服从 $\\{1,2,\\cdots,2^{n R}\\}$ 上的均匀分布时，有
