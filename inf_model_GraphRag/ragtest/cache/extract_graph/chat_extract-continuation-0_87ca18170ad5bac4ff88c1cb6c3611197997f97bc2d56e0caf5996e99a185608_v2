\n\n定理6.1.2(按比例下注是对数最优化的） 最优化双倍率的公式计算如下  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{W^{\\star}\\left(\\mathbf{p}\\right)=\\sum\\phi_{i}\\mathrm{log}o_{i}-H\\left(\\mathbf{p}\\right)}\\end{array}\n$$\n\n并且按比例b\\*=p的下注策略可以达到该值。  \n\n证明：我们将函数 W(b,p)重新改写，使得容易看出何时取最大值:  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{W(\\mathbf{b},\\mathbf{p})=\\sum\\fint_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}_{\\mathbf{i}}\\log\\fint_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}_{i}o_{i}}\\ &{\\qquad=\\sum\\fint_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}_{j_{i}}\\log\\left(\\frac{b_{i}}{\\phi_{i}}_{\\phi_{i}}\\right)\\qquad\\mathrm{~.~}}\\ &{\\qquad=\\sum\\fint_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}_{j_{i}}\\log o_{i}-H(\\mathbf{\\phi}\\mathbf{p})-D(\\mathbf{\\phi}\\mathbf{p}\\parallel\\mathbf{\\phi}\\mathbf{b})}\\ &{\\qquad\\leqslant\\sum\\fint_{\\mathbf{\\phi}_{i}}\\log o_{i}-H(\\mathbf{\\phi}\\mathbf{p})}\\end{array}\n$$\n\n等号成立的充要条件是 b=p(即马民应该按照每匹马获胜的概率按比例分散地购买马票)。  \n\n例6.1.1考虑仅有两匹马参赛的特殊情形。假设马 1 获胜的概率为 P1，马 2 获胜的概率为p2。假设两匹马的机会收益率均等（即两只马票均为2兑1方式）。此时的最优下注方法为按概  \n\n率比例下注，即 $b_{1}=p_{1},b_{2}=p_{2}\\circ$ 而最优双倍率为 $\\begin{array}{r}{W^{\\ast}\\left(\\mathbf{p}\\right)=\\sum\\phi_{i}\\mathrm{log}o_{i}-H(\\mathbf{p})=\\mathbf{1}-H(\\mathbf{p})}\\end{array}$ ，按照这样的增长率，将导致相对收益无限增长：  \n\n$$\nS_{n}{\\doteq}2^{n(1-H(\\mathbf{p}))}\n$$\n\n于是，我们证明了对于一系列独立同分布的赛马，如果马民将其全部现金反复购买马票而不是捂住现金不动，那么按比例下注是相对收益增长最快的策略。  \n\n接下来我们考虑一种特殊情形，即关于某种分布具有公平机会收益倍率的情形。换言之，除了知道 $\\scriptstyle\\sum1/\\ o_{i}=1$ 之外，无其他信息可用。此时，记 $r_{i}=1/o_{i}$ ，将其视为参赛马匹的一种概率密度函数（这是用来估计赛马获胜概率的所谓马民法）。在此记号之下，双倍率可以写为  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r l}&{W(\\mathbf{b},\\mathbf{p})=\\sum\\_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}p_{i}\\mathrm{log}b_{i}o_{i}}\\ &{\\qquad=\\sum\\_{\\mathbf{\\phi}}p_{i}\\mathrm{log}\\biggl(\\frac{b_{i}}{\\phi_{i}}\\frac{\\phi_{i}}{r_{i}}\\biggr)}\\ &{\\qquad=D(\\mathbf{\\phi}\\mathbf{p}\\parallel\\mathbf{r})-D(\\mathbf{\\phi}\\mathbf{p}\\parallel\\mathbf{b})}\\end{array}\n$$\n\n该方程给出了相对熵距离的另一个解释：双倍率正好是马民法的估计到真实分布的距离与马民下注策略到真实分布的距离之间的差值。所以，马民要赚钱，只有当他的估计（由 $\\mathbf{b}$ 表示）比马民\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KELLY GAMING<|>EVENT<|>Kelly Gaming is a strategy in betting where the bettor
