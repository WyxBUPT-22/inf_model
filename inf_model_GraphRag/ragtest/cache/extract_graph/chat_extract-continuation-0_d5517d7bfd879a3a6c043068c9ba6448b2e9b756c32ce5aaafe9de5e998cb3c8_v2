\n\n定理16.5.3(股票市场的AEP）假设 $\\mathbf{X}_{1},\\mathbf{X}_{2},\\cdots,\\mathbf{X}_{n}$ 是一个平稳遍历的向量值随机过程。令  \n\n$S_{n}^{\\ast}$ 为采用条件对数最优策略在时刻 $_{n}$ 所获得的相对收益，即  \n\n$$\nS_{n}^{*}=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}{\\bf{h}}_{i}^{*}{}^{t}({\\bf{X}}_{1},{\\bf{X}}_{2},\\cdots,{\\bf{X}}_{i-1}){\\bf{X}}_{i}\n$$\n\n那么，依概率1有  \n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n}\\mathrm{log}S_{n}^{\\ast}{\\rightarrow}W_{\\infty}^{\\ast}\n$$\n\n证明：定理的证明过程设及16.8节中将证明AEP的“三明治\"[20]方法生成。此处暂不给出详细的证明(Algoet and Cover[21])。  \n\n在结束本节之前，再次考虑赛马的例子。赛马是股票市场的一个特殊情形，只要认定该市场中的 $\\mathbf{\\nabla}_{m}$ 只股票怡好对应着 $\\mathbf{\\nabla}_{m}$ 匹赛马。当比赛结束时，第 $\\dot{\\iota}$ 匹赛马所对应的马票要么为0要么为$o_{i}$ ，其中， $o_{i}$ 为买第 $\\mathbf{\\chi}_{i}$ 匹赛马的机会收益率。于是， $\\mathbf{X}$ 的非0分量总是对应于获胜的赛马。  \n\n在这种情况下，对数最优投资组合是按比例下注，此乃著名的Kelly 博弈策略（即， ${b}_{i}^{\\ast}={\\pmb{\\mathscr{p}}}_{i},$ 一如果机会收益是均匀公平的（即， $\\boldsymbol{o}_{i}=\\boldsymbol{m},\\forall~i~)$ ，那么我们有  \n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{W}^{\\star}=\\log{m}-H(\\boldsymbol{X})\n$$\n\n假如有一个相关的赛马序列，那么最优投资组合是按照条件比例博弈。如果这样，渐近增长率为  \n\n$$\nW_{\\infty}^{\\star}=\\log m-H(\\chi)\n$$\n\n其中，当极限存在时， $H({\\mathcal{X}})=\\operatorname*{lim}{\\frac{1}{n}}H(X_{1},X_{2},\\cdots,X_{n}).$ 。此时，定理16.5.3保证  \n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{S}_{n}^{*}\\overset{*}{=}2^{n\\boldsymbol{W}^{*}}\n$$\n\n这与第6章中的结果一致。  \n\n# 16.6对数最优投资组合的竞争最优性  \n\n是否对数最优投资组合在指定的有限时刻 $_{n}$ 总是比其他的投资组合优越？作为库恩－塔克条件的一个直接推论，我们有  \n\n$$\nE{\\frac{S_{n}}{S_{n}^{*}}}{\\leqslant}1\n$$\n\n从而，由马尔可夫不等式可知  \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Pr}(S_{n}{>}t S_{n}^{\\ast}){\\leqslant}\\frac{1}{t}\n$$\n\n该结果类似于第5章中已经导出的关于香农码的竞争最优性。  \n\n通过例子可以发现，对于使得 $S_{n}>S_{n}^{*}$ 成立的概率的上界，我们不可能再做出更好的估计。例如，假设股票市场只有两种股票，并且只有两种可能结果，  \n\n$$\n\\left(X_{1},X_{2}\\right)={\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{\\left(1,{\\frac{1}{1-\\varepsilon}}\\right)}\\ {\\left(1,0\\right)}\\end{array}\\right.}\n$$\n\n在该市场中，对数最优投资组合的方案\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALGOET AND
