\n\n双程信道与干扰信道非常类似，但具有以下附加规定：发送器1与接收器2相连，发送器2与接收器1相连，如图15-6所示。因此，发送器1可由接收器2以前接收到的信号决定下一步该发送什么。该信道展现了网络信息论的另一个基本特征：反馈。反馈使发送器可互相使用彼此的部分信息而实现相互协作。  \n\n一般情形下的双程信道容量区域还不知道。该信道是香农[4861首先提出的，他获得了该区域的上下界（参见习题15.15）。对高斯信道，这两个界重合，因此，高斯信道的容量区域已为人们所知。事实上，高斯双程信道可以分解为两个独立信道。  \n\n![](images/9830e89918352e49ea199973a4f054fcb2d9b56640ec0c871ff129819001c8c4.jpg)  \n图 15-6双程信道  \n\n设 $P_{1}$ 与 $P_{2}$ 分别为发送器1与2的功率， $N_{1}$ 与 $N_{2}$ 为两信道的噪声方差。那么码率 $R_{1}<$ C( P1/N,)与 R2< C(P2/N2)是可达的，这可以利用在干扰信道中描述的技术来实现。此时产生两个码率分别为 R，与 R2的码簿。发送器1发送第一码簿中的码字。接收器 2 接收到两个发送器发送的码字以及噪声的叠加信号。只要简单地从叠加信号中剔除发送器2发送的码字，就可获得一个等同于直接从发送器1到接收器2 的净化了的信道(仅有方差为 N的噪声)。于是，双程高斯信道分解为两个独立高斯信道。但是，这并不代表一般的双程信道。一般情况下，两个发送器之间存在着一种平衡关系，使得它们不可能同时以最优码率传送信息。  \n\n# 15.2联合典型序列  \n\n我们已通过考虑多用户高斯信道，预示了网络中容量的一些结论。本节我们给出详尽的分析，首先需要给出第7章中证明过的联合 AEP的推广形式，来证明网络信息论中的定理。联合渐近均分性质(AEP)将使我们能够计算本章中考虑到的各种编码方案的联合典型译码的误差概率。  \n\n设 $(X_{1},X_{2},\\cdots,X_{k})$ 为有限个离散随机变量的集合，其固定联合分布为 $\\scriptstyle{\\pmb{\\mathscr{p}}}(x_{1},x_{2},\\cdots,x_{k})$ （x1，2，，)∈×2×…×k。设S为这些随机变量的一个有序子集，并考虑 S的n次  \n\n独立重复 $\\mathbf{S}{=}\\left(S_{1},S_{2},\\cdots,S_{n}\\right)$ ，其中所有 $S_{i}=S$ 。于是  \n\n$$\n\\operatorname*{Pr}\\{\\mathbf{S}=\\mathbf{s}\\}=\\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\operatorname*{Pr}\\{S_{i}=s_{i}\\}\\qquad\\mathbf{s}\\in S^{n}\n$$\n\n其中 $s$ 表示 S中全体随机变量所对应的字母表的乘积空间。例如，若 $S=(X_{j},X_{l})$ ，则 $\\scriptstyle{\\mathcal{S}}={\\mathcal{X}}_{j}\\times{\\mathcal{X}}_{l}$ ,且  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{\\displaystyle\\mathrm{Pr}\\{\\mathbf{S}=\\mathbf{s}\\}=\\mathrm{Pr}\\{\\left(\\mathbf{X}_{j},\\mathbf{X}_{l}\\right)=\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{j},\\mathbf{x}_{l}\\right)\\}}}\\
