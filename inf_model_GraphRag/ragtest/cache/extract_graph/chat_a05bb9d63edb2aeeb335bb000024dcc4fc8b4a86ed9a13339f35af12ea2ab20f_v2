历史回顾  \n\n本章内容是在ElGamal和Cover 的评论性文章[186］的基础上整理而成的。香农［486」于1961年对双程信道进行了研究，并且给出了关于容量区域的内界与外界概念。Dueck[175」与Schalkwijk[464,465]提出了针对双程信道的某些编码方案，其可达码率能够超过香农的内界；该信道的外界是由Zhang等在[596]以及Willems与Hekstra在[558]中得到。  \n\nAhlswede[7]和Liao[355]找到了多接人信道的容量区域，随后Slepian与WolfL501」将其推厂为带有公共信息的多接人信道情形。Gaarder与Wolf[220]首次证明反馈可以增加离散无记忆多接入信道的容量。Cover和Leung[133]关于带反馈多接入信道提出了可达区域的概念，并证明这个区域对于由Willems[557]提出的一类多接人信道都是最优的。Ozarow[410]确定出带反馈的两用户高斯多接人信道的容量区域。Cover et al.[129］以及Ahlswede和Han[12]也考虑过相关的信源在一个多接人信道上的传输问题。Slepian-Wolf定理的证明是由Slepian和WolfL502』给出的，Cover在[122]中利用装盒子的方法将定理推广到了联合遍历信源情形。  \n\nCover在1972年发表的文章[119]中对广播信道进行了研究，而退化广播信道的容量区域是由 Bergmans[55]和Gallager[225]获得的。针对退化广播信道提出的叠加编码方案也是低噪声的广播信道(Kormner 和 Marton[324])，大容量的广播信道(ElGamal[185]），以及具有退化消息集的广播信道(Kormer 和 Marton[325])等信道的最优化方案。Van der Meulen[526]和 Cover[121]提出了针对一般广播信道的可达区域。确定型广播信道的容量是由Gelfand与平斯克[242，243，423］以及 Marton[377]发现的。其中关于广播信道最为�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek/deepseek-v3",
