道是对于许多普通的通信信道的概括，比如有线与无线电话信道和卫星链接信道。若无进一步的条件限制，该信道的容量可以为无穷。如果噪声的方差为零，接收者可以完全无误地收到每一个被传输的字符。由于 $X$ 可以取任意实值，所以这个信道可以准确无误地传输任何一个实数。  \n\n如果噪声方差不为0且对输入信号没有限制，可以选择输入信号的一个任意分散的无穷子集，使得我们可以在输出端口以任意小的误差概率识别它们。该方案也具有无穷的容量。于是，如果噪声方差为0或者对输人信号没有限制，则信道的容量为无穷。  \n\n![](images/c948e6100786561bfb9c948ac9832debc73fb3ac2d91edb2c30b73ad87c6d96a.jpg)  \n图 9-1高斯信道  \n\n对输人最通常的限制是在能量或者功率方面的约束。假定对于平均功率的约束，即对于信道上传输的任意码字 $(x_{1},x_{2},\\cdots,x_{n})$ ，我们要求  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{1}{n}}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}\\leqslant P\n$$\n\n这样的通信信道模拟许多实际的信道，包括无线电和卫星通信。信道中的可加噪声可能源于各种各样的因素。然而，根据中心极限定理可知，大量的小随机事件的累积效果渐近于正态分布，所以在许多情形下高斯假设都是有效的。  \n\n首先分析一个简单的次优方法来使用该信道。假定使用该信道一次发送1比特消息。在额定功率限制下，最佳方案是发送 $+\\sqrt{P}$ 和 $-\\sqrt{P}$ 之中的一个。接收者根据接收到的 $Y$ 来揣测发送的是两个中哪一个。假定二者是等可能的(若我们想发送1比特的消息，这恰好相符），则最优的译码规则为：当 $Y{\\mathbf{>}}0$ 时认为发送的是 $+\\sqrt{P}$ ，而当 $Y{<}0$ 时认为发送的是 $-\\sqrt{P}$ 。此译码方案的误差概率是  \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}{{P_{e}=\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{Pr}(\\left.Y<0\\right|X=+\\sqrt{P})+\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{Pr}(\\left.Y>0\\right|X=-\\sqrt{P})}}\\ {{=\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{Pr}(Z<-\\sqrt{P}\\mid X=+\\sqrt{P})+\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{Pr}(Z>\\sqrt{P}\\mid X=-\\sqrt{P})}}\\ {{=\\mathrm{Pr}(Z>\\sqrt{P})}}\\ {{=1-\\Phi(\\sqrt{P/N})}}\\end{array}\n$$\n\n其中 $\\Phi(x)$ 是累积正态分布函数  \n\n$$\n\\Phi(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{x}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi}}\\mathrm{e}^{\\frac{-t^{2}}{2}}\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\n\n若使用如此的方案，将一个高斯信道转换成一个交叉概率为 $P_{e}$ 的离散二元对称信道。类似地，如果使用四输人信号，可将高斯信道转换成一个离散四元输人信道。在一些实际的调制方案中，  \n\n类似的思想也应用于将连续信道转换为离散信道的情况。离散信道的主要优点是易于对输出符号做纠错处理，但是在量化的过程中某些信息会丢失。  \n\n# 9.1高斯信道：定义  \n\n我们现在定义信道的(信息)容量，它是输人和输出之间的互信息关于满足功率限制的所有输人分布的最大值。
