的接收工作包括：首先通过找出第二码薄最接近的码字来发现协助码字的下标；其次，从接收到的序列剔除这个最接近的码字，并且计算出 $2^{n R_{\\mathfrak{o}}}$ 个下标的清单，使其对应于第一一码簿中所有这样的码字，它们可能已被送到第二组。  \n\n接下来就该是最终目标接收器来完成关于第一组传输中发送出的第-个码簿中的码字的计算工作。当它取得所有可能是第一组传输发送出的码字清单之后，检查清单与划分的特定单元（已经从第二组传输协助的中继传输中知道了该单元的编号）相交的情况。假定已经选取了码率与功率，使得交集中以高概率仅含1个码字，那么，这个惟一的码字就作为在获得第一组发送出的信息条件下Y的估计。  \n\n现在进人一种稳定的状态。在每一组新的传输中，发送器与中继站可以协作解决前一次留下的清单的不确定性。另外，发送器在传输第二个码簿中码字的同时将来自第一码簿中的新信息叠加上去，然后传输该叠加信息。接收器总是落后一组，但当发送的传输组数足够多时，这并不影响总体接收速率。  \n\n# 15.1.5 高斯干扰信道  \n\n干扰信道有两个发送器与两个接收器。发送器1希望对接收器1传递信息，并不关心接收器2  \n\n会收到或者泄密。发送器2与接收器2也同样如此。每个信道之间相互干扰。该信道如图15-5所示。它并非真正的广播信道，因为对每个发送器，仅有一个目标接收器；也不是多接人信道，因为每个接收器仅对相应的发送器发送的信息感兴趣。对于对称干扰的情形，我们有  \n\n$$\nY_{1}=X_{1}+a X_{2}+Z_{1}\n$$\n\n$$\nY_{2}=X_{2}+a X_{1}+Z_{2}\n$$\n\n其中 $Z_{1},Z_{2}$ 是两个独立的服从 $\\mathcal{N}(0,N)$ 的随机变量。该信道即使在高斯情形下也没有一般解。但是很明显，无论是在高干扰还是在无干扰情形下，信道的容量  \n区域都是相同的。  \n\n要获得该结论，需要产生两个功率为 $P$ 且码率为$C(P/N)$ 的码簿。每个发送器从其码簿中选出一个码字并将其发送。假如干扰 $\\alpha$ 满足 $C\\left(\\l{\\alpha}^{2}P/(P+N)\\right)>C\\left(P/$ $N)$ ，那么第一个发送器完全清楚第二个发送器所用的下标，因为它可以通过搜索与它收到的信号最接近的码字这种寻常的方法来找到该下标。当它找到该信号之后，可以从接收到的波形中减去该信号。于是，它与自己的发送器之间形成了一个净化了的信道。然后，它从发送器使用的码簿中搜索出最接近的码字，并宣布该码字就是发送器1所发送的码字。
