Identify all entities.

对应的阶梯高度的1/2。区间的下端位于对应阶梯的下一半中，于是区间的上端位于对应阶梯的顶部之下，故而在累积分布函数之中，任一码字对应的区间都真包含于相应字符所对应的阶梯中。所以不同码字对应的区间不相交，此码是无前缀的。注意，该程序没有要求字符按其概率大小顺序排列。在习题5.5.28 中，给出了要求概率值排列有序的另一个编码程序。  \n\n由于使用 $l(\\boldsymbol{x})=\\left\\lceil\\log\\frac{1}{\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x})}\\right\\rceil+1$ +1 比特来表示 x，则编码的期望长度为  \n\n$$\nL=\\sum_{x}{\\hat{p(x)}l(x)}=\\sum_{x}p(x){\\biggl(}{\\biggl\\lceil}\\log{\\frac{1}{\\hat{p(x)}}}{\\biggl\\rceil}+1{\\biggr)}<H(X)+2\n$$\n\n因此，该编码方案的期望码长不会超过熵值2比特。  \n\n.例5.9.1首先考虑下面的例子，其中所有概率值都是二进制的。码的构造如下表：  \n\n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>x</td><td>p(x)</td><td>F(x)</td><td>F(x)</td><td>F(x)的二进制表示</td><td></td><td>1 logp(x) 1 +1</td><td>码字</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.125</td><td>0.001</td><td></td><td>3</td><td>001</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.75</td><td>0.5</td><td>0.10</td><td>2</td><td></td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0.125</td><td>0.875</td><td>0.8125</td><td>0.1101</td><td>4</td><td></td><td>1101</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>0.125</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.9375</td><td>0.1111</td><td>4</td><td></td><td>1111</td></tr></table></body></html>  \n\n在此情形下，期望码长为2.75比特，而熵为1.75比特。对于这个例子，赫夫曼编码的期望码长恰好与熵相等。注意表格中给出的码字，显然存在着某些无效性，如最后两个码字的最后一位均可删除。但是，如果删除所有码字的最后一位，那么所得到的码就不再是无前缀的了。  \n\n例5.9.2现在给出构造Shannon-Fano-Elias 码的另-个例子。在此例中，由于分布不是二进制的，所以 F(x)的二进制表示可能有无穷位数字。用0.01表示0.01010101…。构造的码如下表：  \n\n<html><body><table><tr><td>x</td><td>p(x)</td><td>F(x)</td><td>F(x)</td><td>F(x)的二进制表示</td><td>log p(x) 1.
