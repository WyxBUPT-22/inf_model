 \n\n# 历史回顾  \n\n渐近均分性（AEP)首先是由香农在1948年的开创性论文[472]中进行了论述，他针对i.i.d.过程的结果给予了证明，并且讨论了平稳遍历过程的结果。McMillan[384]和Breiman[74]证明了遍历有限字母表上的信源的 AEP。该结论现在称为 AEP 或 Shannon-McMillan-Breiman 定理。Chung[101]将定理推广到可数字母表情形，而Moy[392］，Perez[418］和Kieffer[312］证明了当$\\{X_{i}\\}$ 连续取值且遍历时的 $\\mathcal{L}_{1}$ 收敛性。Barron[34]和Orey[402]证明了实值遍历过程的几乎处处收敛性；在16.8节中将利用简单的三明治方法(Algoet和Cover[20])证明-一般的AEP。  \n\n# 第4章 随机过程的熵率  \n\n第3章中的渐近均分性质表明在平均意义下使用 $\\pmb{n H(X)}$ 比特足以描述 $\\pmb{n}$ 个独立同分布的随机变量。但是，如果随机变量不独立，尤其是随机变量成为平稳过程时，情况又如何呢？我们将证明，正如i.i.d.情形，熵 $H(X_{1},X_{2},\\cdots,X_{n})$ 随 $\\pmb{n}$ 以速率 $H(\\mathcal{X})$ (渐近地)线性增加，这个速率称为过程的熵率。至于 $H({\\mathcal{X}})$ 为什么可以解释为最佳的可达数据压缩，待到第5章中再作分析。  \n\n# 4.1马尔可夫链  \n\n随机过程 $\\{X_{i}\\}$ 是一个带下标的随机变量序列。一般允许随机变量间具有任意的相关性。刻画一个过程需要知道所有有限的联合概率密度函数
