 \n\n# 16.7 万能投资组合  \n\n在 16.1节中开发的对数最优投资组合策略依赖于股票向量的分布已知的假设，基于该分布才能计算出最优投资组合 $\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}$ 。但在实际中,往往不知如何得到该分布。本节我们介绍一种因果投资组合，其对于单个的序列有很好的表现。于是，我们除了必须假设股票市场可以看作是一个向量列 ${\\bf{x}}_{1},{\\bf{x}}_{2},\\cdots,\\in\\mathcal{R}_{+}^{m}$ 之外，不再作任何统计假设了。其中， $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ 表示全部股票第 $\\pmb{\\i}$ 天的相对价格构成的向量，而其分量 $x_{i j}$ 表示第 $j$ 只股票第 $\\dot{\\iota}$ 天的相对价格。我们首先针对有限长度的情形，即，只依据已经发生的 $_n$ 个向量 $\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\mathbf{x}_{2},\\cdots,\\mathbf{x}_{n}$ 。然后再推广到无穷情形。  \n\n已知股票市场的股票序列之后，我们到底能够做得多好？可实现的最大的增长率当属由事后诸葛亮式的恒定持仓比例投资组合策略得出的增长率。此策略是基于已知的股票市场向量构成的序列的条件下的最佳恒定持仓比例投资组合。注意，恒定持仓比例投资组合是可以与服从已知分布的独立同分布的股市序列的策略抗衡的依者。所以，考虑这样的投资组合策略是顺理成章的。  \n\n我们假设有～揽子共同基金，其中每只共同基金都执行恒定持仓比例投资组合策略。我们的目的是实现对这些基金的最佳管理。本节我们将证明，即使在没有股市向量分布的先验知识的情况下，我们也能够凭借最佳恒定持仓比例投资组合策略做得很好。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model":
