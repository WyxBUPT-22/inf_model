\n图1-2通信理论的信息论临界点  \n\nI(X；Y)就是信道容量。因此，所有调制方案和数据压缩方案都必须介于这两个临界值之间。信息论也提供能够达到这些临界值的通信方案。从理论上讲，最佳通信方案固然很好，但从计算的角度看，它们往往是不切实际的。惟一的原因是，只有使用简单的调制与解调方案时才具有计算可行性，而香农信道容量定理的证明过程中所提出的随机编码和最邻近译码规则却不然。集成电路与编码设计方面的进展使得我们能获得香农理论所蕴涵的一些硕果。随着Turbo码的诞生，最终实现了计算的实用性。比如，纠错码在光盘和DVD中的应用就是信息论的一个绝好实例。  \n\n信息论中关于通信方面的近期研究集中在网络信息论：存在干扰和噪声的情况下，大量发送器到大量接收器之间的通信同步率理论。目前，多个发送器与多个接收器之间的一些速率协定还无法预料，已有协定也有待于从数学上得到一定程度的简化。因而，一套统一的理论尚待发掘。  \n\n计算机科学(科尔莫戈罗夫复杂度）。科尔莫戈罗夫、Chaitin和 Solomonoff 指出，一组数据串的复杂度可以定义为计算该数据串所需的最短二进制程序的长度。因此，复杂度就是最小描述长度。利用这种方式定义的复杂度是通用的，即与具体的计算机无关，因此该定义具有相当重要的意义。科尔莫戈罗夫复杂度的定义为描述复杂度的理论奠定了基础。更令人愉快的是，如果序列服从熵为 $H$ 的分布，那么该序列的科尔莫戈罗夫复杂度 $K$ 近似等于香农熵 $H$ 。所以信息论与科尔莫戈罗夫复杂度二者有着非常紧密的联系。实际上，科尔莫戈罗夫复杂度比香农熵更为基础。它不仅是数据压缩的临界值，而且也可以导出逻辑上一致的推理过程。  \n\n算法复杂度与计算复杂度二者之间存在着微妙的互补关系。计算复杂度（也就是时间复杂度）与科尔莫戈罗夫复杂度（也就是程序长度或描述复杂度）可以看成是对应于程序运行时间与程序长度的两条轴。科尔莫戈罗夫复杂度是沿第二条轴的最小化问题，而计算复杂度是沿第-一条轴的最小化问题。沿两条轴同时进行最小化的工作几乎没有。  \n\n物理学（热力学）。熵与热力学第二定律都诞生于统计力学。对于孤立系统，永远增加。热力学第二定律的贡献之一是促使我们抛弃了存在永动机的幻想。我们将在第4章中简述该定律。  \n\n数学（概率论和统计学）。信息论中的基本量一熵、相对熵与互信息，定义成概率分布的泛函数。它们中的任何一个量都能刻画随机变量长序列的行为特征，使得我们能够估计稀有事件的概率（大偏差理论），并且在假设检验中找到最佳的误差指数。  \n\n科学的哲学观（奥克姆�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
