�子密度函数已知。胶片感光不需要知道碘酸银粒子的位置。于是，当其感光后，接收者看到的只是曝光了的碘酸银粒子。附着在细胞上且暴露的颗粒假设落在或这或那而导致空白出现。没有被感光的碘酸银粒子与空位置仍是空白。现在的问题是：这种胶片的信道容量是多少？  \n\n我们做如下的假设，在胶片的区域dA打上非常精细的格子将其划分成为许多细胞，假设每个细胞中至多一一个碘酸银粒子并且不在细胞的边界上。于是，胶片可以看作是一系列具有交叉概率 $1-\\lambda d A$ 的并联二元不对称信道。通过计算该二元不对称信道的容量关于 $d A$ 的一阶近似(这是必要的近似)。我们可以计算出该胶片的信道容量(量纲为比特/平方英寸)。显然，它与 $\\lambda$ 成比例。问题是：该比例常数是多少？  \n\n如果照明器和接收器知道都知道晶体的位置，那么答案将是 $\\lambda$ 比特/单位面积。  \n\n9.11高斯互信息。假设 $(X,Y,Z)$ 是联合高斯分布且 $X{\\rightarrow Y{\\rightarrow Z}}$ 形成一个马尔可夫链，令 $X$ 和Y的相关系数为 $\\rho_{1}$ ，而 $Y$ 和 $Z$ 有相关系数为

N(\\mathbf{0},K),K=\\left[{\\begin{array}{c c}{1}&{\\rho}\\ {\\rho}&{1}\\end{array}}\\right]\\operatorname{c}$ ，分别求出在迹(功率)约束 $\\mathrm{tr}(K_{X}){\\leqslant}2P$ 情形下有与没有反馈的log 的最大值。  \n\n9.14可加噪声信道。考虑信道 Y=X+Z，其中 X是功率约束为P的发射信号，Z是独立可加噪声， $Y$ 是接收到的信号，令  \n\n$$\nZ=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l l}{{0}}&{{\\mathrm{iff}\\eta\\gg\\eta_{10}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\
