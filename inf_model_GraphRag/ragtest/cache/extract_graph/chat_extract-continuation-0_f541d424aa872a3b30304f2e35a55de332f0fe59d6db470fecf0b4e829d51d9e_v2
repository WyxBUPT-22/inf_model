\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n}\\mathrm{log}P_{e}^{(n)}{\\leqslant}\\mathrm{log}{\\textstyle\\sum}P_{1}^{\\lambda}(x)P_{2}^{1-\\lambda}(x)\n$$\n\n由于上式对任意的0≤入≤1均成立，所以，在 0≤入≤1上取最小值，即可得到Chermoff 信息界。  \n于是，证明了误差概率指数不会比 $C(P_{1},P_{2})$ 更佳。该指数的可达性可由定理11.9.1得到。  \n\n可注意到，只要 $\\pmb{\\pi_{1}}$ 和 $\\pi_{2}$ 非零，则贝叶斯误差指数是不依赖于 $\\pi_{1}$ 和 $\\pi_{2}$ 的实际取值的。从本质上说，对于大样本，由先验知识所产生的效应会消失。最优决策准则是选择具有最大后验概率的假设，对应于检验  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{\\pi_{1}P_{1}(X_{1},X_{2},\\cdots,X_{n})}{\\pi_{2}P_{2}(X_{1},X_{2},\\cdots,X_{n})}}\\leq1\n$$\n\n对上式取对数并除以 $\\pmb{n}$ ，该检验可重新写成  \n\n$$\n{\\frac{1}{n}}\\mathrm{log}{\\frac{\\pi_{1}}{\\pi_{2}}}+{\\frac{1}{n}}\\sum_{i}\\log{\\frac{P_{1}(X_{i})}{P_{2}(X_{i})}}\\leq0\n$$\n\n其中，第二项趋于 D(P1Ⅱ P2)或- D(P2I P)取决于真实分布为 P 或 P2。而第一项趋于 0，因而，由先验分布所产生的效应消失。  \n\n最后，为完善对大偏差理论和假设检验的讨论，考虑关于条件极限定理的例子。  \n\n例11.9.1假定棒球联合总会的棒球选手的击球平均得分数为260，其标准偏差是15，而假定小俱乐部联合会的棒球选手的击球平均得分数为240，其标准偏差是15。现有来自某一俱乐部(俱乐部是随机选取的)的100 名选手组成一支球队，发现该队的击球平均得分数超过250，因而判定是棒球联合会的成员。但我们被告知这个判定是错误的，即这些选手是小俱乐部联合会的成员。对于这100名选手，我们可否知晓击球平均得分数的分布该是什么呢？从条件极限定理可知关于这些选手的击球平均得分数的分布的均值为250而标准偏差是15。为清楚此事，将问题抽象如下。  \n\n考虑关于两个高斯分布 $f_{1}=\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{1},\\sigma^{2})$ 和 $f_{2}=\\mathcal{N}({-1},\\sigma^{2})$ 间的检验情况，它们具有不同的均值但方差相同。如11.8节所讨论的，此情形下似然比检验等价于比较样本均值与阈值。贝叶斯检验是“若
