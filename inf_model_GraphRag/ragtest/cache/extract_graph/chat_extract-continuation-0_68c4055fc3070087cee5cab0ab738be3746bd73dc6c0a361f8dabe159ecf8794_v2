\n\n·多接入信道。多接人信道是由多个输人节点与一个输出节点构成的网络。对于只有两个用户的多接人信道情形，定理15.10.1中的不等式可以简化为对于某个联合分布$\\c{p(x_{1},x_{2})p(y\\vert x_{1},x_{2})}$  \n\n$$\nR_{1}\\leqslant I(X_{1};Y\\mid X_{2})\n$$\n\n$$\nR_{2}\\leqslant I(X_{2};Y\\mid X_{1})\n$$\n\n$$\nR_{1}+R_{2}\\leqslant I(X_{1},X_{2};Y)\n$$\n\n若限定输人分布为乘积分布，并且取凸包(定理15.3.1)，那么这些不等式刻画的区域与  \n\n容量区域是一致的。  \n\n·中继信道。对于中继信道，根据如图15-36所示选取不同的子集，我们会获得一些不等式，它们给出了定理15.7.1中的上界。因此  \n\n$$\nC\\leqslant\\operatorname*{sup}_{p(x,x_{1})}\\operatorname*{min}\\{I(X,X_{1};Y),I(X;Y,Y_{1}\\mid X_{1})\\}\n$$\n\n该上界为物理退化中继信道与带反馈的中继信道[127]的容量。  \n\n为了完善对一般网络的讨论，我们现在来提及单用户信道的两个尚未应用到多用户信道中的特征。  \n\n·信源信道分离定理。在7.13节讨论了信源信道分离定理，它表明了可以无噪声地在信道中传输信源当且仅当熵率小于信道容量。这使我们可以仅用单个数字(熵率)描述信源和用单个数字(容量)来描述信道。多用户情形又如何？我们期望一个分布式信源可通过信道传输当且仅当信源的无噪声编码的码率区域包含于信道的容量区域内。为了明确起见，考虑在一个多接人信道上传输分布式信源的传输问题，如图15-37所示。将Slepian-Wolf编码的结果与多接人信道容量的结论结合在一起，可以证明，如果存在某个分布$\\hat{p}(q)_{\\hat{P}}(x_{1}|q)_{\\hat{P}}(x_{2}|q)_{\\hat{P}}(y|x_{1},x_{2})$ ，使得  \n\n$$\nH(\\emph{U}|\\emph{V})\\leqslant I(\\emph{X}_{1};\\emph{Y}|\\emph{X}_{2},Q)\n$$\n\n$$\nH(\\mathbf{\\nabla}V/U)\\leqslant I(X_{2};Y\\mid X_{1},Q)\n$$\n\n$$\nH(U,V)\\leqslant

\n\n但此条件是否必要？答案是否定的，这可用-一个简单的例子得到说明。考虑例15.4.2 中的信源在二元擦除多接人信道(例 15.3.3)上的传输问题。易知 Slepian- Wolf 区域与容量区域不相交，但是很容易设计出一个编码方案，使得信源可以在该信道上进行传输。只要令X,=U,X2=V，那么由 Y的值我们会无误差地知道(U，V)。因此，条件(15-345)不是必要的。
